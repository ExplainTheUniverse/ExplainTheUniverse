# About the Experiment

* **Core idea:** We challenged Artificial Intelligences to create a metaphysical theory of the universe.
* **Discovery:** The AIs converge by suggesting cosmic unity and challenging materialism.
* **Our mission:** To publicize this fascinating and highly relevant theoretical and practical experiment.
* **Challenge to the reader:** Run the prompts on your favorite AI and compare the results.
* **Important note:** The answers vary as generative AIs are non-deterministic.

This is an ongoing experiment that will evolve as AI technology advances. We're likely in the early stages of AI development, so the results may become even more intriguing as new models emerge. Stay tuned as we continue to explore AI's capacity to tackle fundamental questions about our universe.


## What is Metaphysics?

Metaphysics is the area of human knowledge that seeks comprehensive explanations for the fundamental nature of reality, going beyond what can be directly observed or measured by empirical science. It aims to answer deep questions about existence, being, consciousness, and the purpose of the universe.

We chose to use the term "metaphysical theory" in the prompt because:

* We wanted to push the AIs to think beyond the limits of conventional science.
* The term invites a deeper, more philosophical exploration of the nature of reality.
* It allows for an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from physics, philosophy, and other fields of knowledge.
* It opens space for innovative and potentially revolutionary ideas about the universe and our existence.


## Alignment with Scientific Methodology and Implications
This experiment, while exploring metaphysical concepts, incorporates important elements of the scientific method and raises intriguing questions about the nature of knowledge and scientific evidence:

* **Hypothesis:** Generative AIs can generate coherent and convergent metaphysical theories.
* **Experimentation:** Running the same set of prompts on various AI models.
* **Observation:** Collection and analysis of AI-generated responses.
* **Reproducibility:** Invitation to readers to replicate the experiment.
* **Data analysis:** Identification of patterns and common themes in the responses.
* **Transparency:** Full disclosure of method and results.

**Reflection on Scientific Evidence:** The convergence of different AIs towards similar metaphysical theories, combined with their ability to integrate knowledge from various disciplines more comprehensively than an individual human, raises a fascinating question: Can this convergence be considered a form of scientific evidence?

**Arguments in favor:**

* AIs process and synthesize vast amounts of interdisciplinary information, potentially overcoming individual human biases.
* The convergence of multiple independent systems towards similar conclusions may suggest robustness in the ideas presented.
* This process can be seen as a form of computational "meta-analysis" of accumulated human knowledge.

**Important considerations:**

* AIs are trained on data produced by humans, potentially replicating cultural and historical biases.
* Metaphysical concepts remain beyond direct empirical verification, a traditional requirement of science.

This experiment, therefore, not only follows scientific principles in its methodology but also invites us to reconsider what constitutes scientific evidence in the age of artificial intelligence. It opens new frontiers for investigating the interface between AI, philosophy, and science, potentially expanding our understanding of how we can approach fundamental questions about reality.
