# ExplainTheUniverse

Welcome to the ExplainTheUniverse project repository! This project explores how different AI models approach the task of creating a metaphysical theory of the universe.

## About the Project

ExplainTheUniverse is an experiment at the intersection of technology, science, and philosophy. We challenged various Artificial Intelligence models to create metaphysical theories of the universe, aiming to discover emerging patterns and implications.

The project website is live at [explaintheuniverse.org](https://explaintheuniverse.org).
