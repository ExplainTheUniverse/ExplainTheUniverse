I lean toward a form of neutral monism—a view in which the ultimate “stuff” of reality is neither strictly mental nor exclusively physical, but a neutral substrate from which both aspects emerge. This position appears particularly promising because it tries to overcome the Achilles’ heels of both reductionist physicalism (which can struggle to account for the qualitative, subjective “feel” of experience) and extreme idealism (which may have difficulty explaining the reliability and objectivity of scientific discoveries). In neutral monism the apparent duality between mind and matter is resolved by positing that our familiar categories are emergent aspects of a more fundamental, undifferentiated reality.

There are several points that contribute to my conviction in this perspective. First, neutral monism calls for a reexamination of the strict separation between the mental and the physical. Instead of forcing consciousness into the mold of an epiphenomenal byproduct or relegating it to some ill-defined nonphysical realm, this approach suggests that what we call “mental” and “physical” are two complementary ways of describing patterns, relations, or informational structures that originate from the same underlying neutral domain. This dovetails with many modern insights from information theory and the study of complex systems, where structure and relation seem, at least in part, prior in explanatory priority.

When we consider empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary physics, a neutral monist framework can be remarkably accommodating. Take quantum nonlocality: the experimentally verified “spooky” correlations between entangled particles challenge any view that insists on a strict, locally separable material substance. Under neutral monism, the deep, nonlocal connectivity implied by quantum phenomena might be seen as a natural manifestation of an underlying reality that is not partitioned into discrete, spatially localized substances but is more like a continuous, relational field that gives rise to the impression of separate entities. In this light the measurement problem may be reinterpreted as the emergence of a particular “direction”—that is, a particular way in which the neutral substrate differentiates itself—when an interaction (what we call a measurement) occurs, rather than as a mysterious collapse of an objectively defined physical state.

Modern astrophysical puzzles—such as dark matter and dark energy—are also more congenial to a picture in which the phenomena we register as “matter” and “energy” are emergent phenomena. If the neutral substrate possesses rich, pre-spatiotemporal structure, then the gravitational effects we attribute to dark matter might reflect a misinterpretation of the dynamics within that substrate rather than the presence of undiscovered particulate matter. Likewise, dark energy could well be a manifestation of emergent large-scale dynamics that only appear as a force “pushing” on our macroscopic distinctions when we force them into our conventional physical language.

Other theoretical puzzles provide further food for thought. The black hole information paradox—where information appears to be lost in black holes, defying the unitarity expected in quantum theory—might be resolved if one accepts that information is not an intrinsic property of “matter” per se, but rather a mode of description that emerges from the underlying, neutral basis. The modern geometric structures that have surfaced in high-energy physics, such as the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes, hint that the fundamental processes driving particle interactions (and perhaps even space–time itself) are best understood as emerging from deep, relational, and geometric principles. In a neutral monistic framework these mathematically elegant objects are not merely calculational tools but are reflective of the profound symmetry and relational order of the underlying substrate.

The attractiveness of neutral monism lies not only in its ability to potentially explain these diverse phenomena—from the enigmatic features of quantum mechanics to the large-scale mysteries of cosmology—but also in its conceptual unification. By positing that mind and matter are two interrelated “faces” of the same underlying reality, this perspective invites us to reformulate our theories in ways that could naturally incorporate the qualitative aspects of experience and the quantitative precision of physical law. Of course, much work remains to bridge the gap between such a metaphysical picture and a fully testable physical theory, but framing questions in this way may open up new avenues for interdisciplinary research, uniting the study of consciousness with frontier problems in physics.

In summary, while no current metaphysical framework is free from challenges, neutral monism offers an attractive middle path. Its recognition of a common, neutral substrate that gives rise to both the mental and the physical allows it to elegantly accommodate puzzles ranging from quantum nonlocality and the measurement problem to dark matter, dark energy, the black hole information paradox, and new geometric insights into particle interactions. This integrative potential makes it, for me, the most convincing perspective on the nature of reality.
