I find a version of neutral monism—one that posits a single “stuff” underlying both what we call mind and matter—to be a particularly promising framework for integrating the puzzles of both consciousness and modern physics. Let me explain in detail.

1. Philosophy and Rationale for Neutral Monism

Neutral monism holds that the fundamental building blocks of reality are neither inherently mental nor purely physical but “neutral” elements that can manifest either way depending on their organization and context. This view—synthesizing insights from both idealist and physicalist camps—has several appealing features:
 • It avoids the hard dualism of traditional mind–body splits. In analytic idealism, consciousness is primary, while in strict physicalism the physical is fundamental; each runs into explanatory difficulties when trying to account for the other domain. Neutral monism, by positing a common substratum, sidesteps these issues.
 • It has the conceptual flexibility to accommodate the “hard problem” of consciousness. Instead of reducing phenomenal experience merely to physical processes or taking it as ontologically fundamental without physical correlates, neutral monism allows for phenomena to appear differently (mental or physical) based on systemic relations and higher-level patterns.
 • It resonates with some modern scientific hints. Certain trends in physics and mathematics (e.g., the explorations of geometric and algebraic structures underlying quantum field phenomena) suggest that what we consider as distinct “particles” or fields might be emergent from a deeper, more unified structure.

2. Accommodation of Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

A. Consciousness Science
 • The theory bridges the explanatory gap between neural processes and subjective experience. Instead of forcing a one-way reduction (physicalism) or demanding an unexplained fundamentality of consciousness (idealism), it suggests that both neural correlates and subjective experience emerge from reorganizations of an underlying neutral substance or structure. This might explain why certain brain processes correlate so tightly with conscious states without claiming that neurons “cause” qualia in a simplistic sense.

B. Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem
 • Quantum non-locality puzzles us with correlations that defy a simple, local, particle‐based explanation. A neutral monist view suggests that the underlying neutral field is not bound by the classical separations we impose—in other words, non-local effects may be natural manifestations of an inherently interconnected neutral substrate.
 • Similarly, the measurement problem, the puzzle of how a quantum system “chooses” a definite state upon observation, might be reinterpreted as a transition or reconfiguration within that neutral substrate, where the division into a “measured” system and an “observer” is emergent rather than fundamental.

C. Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Modern Cosmological Puzzles
 • Dark matter and dark energy—two phenomena that remain mysterious in the standard particle picture—could be conceived as effects or different states of the underlying neutral substance that do not interact via familiar electromagnetic or baryonic means. In other words, what we term “dark” might simply be another mode of manifestation of the underlying neutral entity.
 • The black hole information paradox, which pits quantum mechanics against classical general relativity, might also find a resolution if one allows that what appears to be a loss of information is instead a misdescription: that information is preserved but expressed differently in the neutral substrate beyond our conventional physical variables.

D. Modern Mathematical Structures: The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes
 • The appearance of novel geometric and combinatorial constructs in high-energy physics—the amplituhedron being a prime example—suggests that much of what we interpret as “particles” or “fields” could be recast in terms of deeper mathematical relationships. In a neutral monism framework, such mathematical objects may well be the natural language of the underlying neutral structure.
 • Similarly, cosmological polytopes—mathematical constructs associated with scattering amplitudes and cosmological correlations—hint that the large‐scale structure of the universe has a hidden, elegant geometry that could be a manifestation of the neutral substrate. This view helps bridge the gap between the language of high-energy physics and that of cosmology.

3. Integration and Challenges

Of course, no single perspective is without challenges. The main questions for a neutral monist framework are how precisely to characterize this “neutral stuff” and how to rigorously derive both the mental and the physical aspects from it. Neither current physics nor neuroscience has yet provided a complete map of this territory. However, what distinguishes a neutral monist perspective is its capacity to incorporate concepts and data from both domains without forcing one merely into the mold of the other. It offers a flexible and promising avenue for reconciling empirical findings—from entangled particles to the subjective realm—with the demands of a coherent metaphysical picture.

4. Conclusion

In summary, I lean toward a form of neutral monism because it offers a unified platform to address deep philosophical problems about the mind, and at the same time it is agile enough to integrate the latest empirical puzzles in quantum physics, cosmology, and even advanced mathematical formulations like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes. Though the full details remain to be worked out, this perspective holds the promise of an elegant and fruitful synthesis across the traditionally disparate realms of subjective experience and objective physical phenomena.
