In my analysis, a version of neutral monism appears to offer the most promising framework for understanding reality. Neutral monism holds that the fundamental substrate of the universe is neither exclusively mental (as in idealism) nor bodily (as in strict physicalism), but rather a “neutral” kind of stuff that underlies both what we call mind and matter. This stance seems to naturally bridge the gap between the subjective and the objective, which is crucial when grappling with issues from consciousness science and modern physics.

Below is a detailed justification and evaluation of how neutral monism addresses various conceptual and empirical puzzles:

1. Philosophical Rigor and Conceptual Advantages

• Avoids Reductionist Pitfalls: 
 Many physicalist approaches reduce mental phenomena to mere epiphenomena of physical processes. However, this reduction often leaves the qualitative, subjective character of consciousness (the “what it is like”) unaccounted for. Neutral monism sidesteps this by positing that both mental and physical phenomena are emergent features of a deeper, neutral substrate. In this light, neither the experiential nor the structural aspects of reality are more “fundamental” than the other—they are two different manifestations of the same underlying reality.

• Integrates Dual Aspects without Dualism:
 Analytic idealism and panpsychism posit that consciousness or proto-mental qualities are intrinsic to the fabric of reality. Neutral monism, by contrast, does not divide reality into distinct mental and physical categories but treats them as complementary aspects of an underlying neutral “stuff.” This harmonizes well with intuitions drawn both from introspective experience (the undeniable immediacy of conscious experience) and from empirical science (the rigorous, quantitatively successful descriptions of matter and energy).

• Philosophical Coherence:
 This perspective has been defended by philosophers who note that the classical dualism—mind on one hand, matter on the other—is plagued by the difficulty of explaining their interaction. With neutral monism, however, one bypasses problems like the “explanatory gap” because there is a single underlying ontology that naturally gives rise to phenomena we call “mental” and “physical.” In this way, the framework is not forced to privilege one mode of description over the other.

2. Accommodation of Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

• Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem:
 Quantum experiments, ranging from Bell’s inequality tests to the peculiarities observed in entangled systems, suggest that conventional local accounts of matter may be incomplete. Within a neutral monist framework, the puzzling correlations implied by quantum non-locality can be viewed as features of an underlying, unified substrate. The seemingly “observer-participant” role in the measurement process might be interpreted as an emergent property of the interplay between the neutral substrate and the ways in which we (as conscious agents) interact with it. This perspective alleviates the sharp observer/observed dichotomy that plagues a straightforward physicalist account.

• Dark Matter and Dark Energy:
 Contemporary cosmology reveals that most of the universe’s mass-energy budget appears in forms (dark matter and dark energy) that are not directly accessible to standard laboratory experiments. From a neutral monist viewpoint, these elusive components might emerge as different “modes” or configurations of the underlying neutral stuff that have structural effects on geometry and evolution without neatly corresponding to what we classically define as matter. In other words, the dark sector could be reinterpreted as a manifestation of the deep, variegated structure intrinsic to the neutral substrate.

• The Black Hole Information Paradox:
 Black holes challenge our intuitions about unitary evolution and information preservation. Within a neutral monism framework, the apparent paradox of information loss can be re-examined: if both physical states and mental (informational) aspects are expressions of a deeper unity, the paradox may dissolve by reconfiguring the question. Rather than seeing information as an abstract imprint solely on a physical medium, one might reconceive it as a relational property emerging from the underlying neutral field that is robust even in extreme gravitational contexts.

• The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes:
 Recent theoretical advances in particle physics, such as the amplituhedron and the discovery of cosmological polytopes, point toward an underlying geometric or combinatorial structure that defies traditional space–time intuitions. These approaches suggest that physical interactions might be derivable from very abstract, non-spatio-temporal mathematical objects. Neutral monism is congenial to such views: if both mental phenomena and what we conventionally call “physical” are emergent from neutral, perhaps even abstract, foundations, then the geometric language used in these discoveries nicely mirrors the idea that our familiar space–time and causal structure are derivative, not fundamental. The “neutral” substrate might well be expressible in such geometric terms, unifying the description of phenomena across disparate scales and domains.

3. Overall Evaluation

Neutral monism—especially in its more modern formulations—permits a flexible ontology that is not forced to categorize everything in strictly mental or physical terms. This flexibility is particularly attractive in a scientific era where issues such as quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, and novel geometric formulations in field theory and cosmology (like the amplituhedron) challenge classical categories.

By embracing a fundamental “stuff” that underlyingly expresses both mental and physical properties, neutral monism:
 – provides a conceptual framework that honors the immediate evidence of conscious experience,
 – is open to reinterpretations of key physical phenomena and puzzles without forcing unnatural dualistic splits, and
 – offers an interpretive bridge between the abstract structures discovered in theoretical physics and the lived, qualitative aspects of experience.

In summary, while no single framework has a complete answer to all puzzles, a neutral monist perspective, when refined and connected with ongoing theoretical developments, appears to be particularly well-suited to accommodate both empirical findings and the conceptual challenges posed by modern physics and consciousness science. Such an approach suggests that the diversity of phenomena we observe—from quantum weirdness to the evolution of cosmic structure—may be understood as different expressions of one underlying neutral reality.
