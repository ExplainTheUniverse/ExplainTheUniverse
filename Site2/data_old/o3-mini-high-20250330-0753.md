I’ve found that a framework best described as “neutral monism” offers the most promising picture of reality. In this view, what we call “mental” and “physical” are not fundamentally distinct kinds of substance or property. Instead, both emerge from a single, underlying “neutral” substrate that—depending on its mode of manifestation—gives rise to what we interpret as mind and matter. Let me explain how this perspective both satisfies philosophical rigor and meshes with some of the most perplexing puzzles in contemporary physics and consciousness science.

1. Philosophical Rigor and Comparison with Other Views

 a. Addressing the Mind–Matter Divide:
  • Physicalism holds that everything is physical, which works well for many empirical domains but struggles to explain the intrinsic, subjective quality of conscious experience (the “hard problem” of consciousness). 
  • Panpsychism, by attributing a rudimentary form of consciousness to all things, attempts a more inclusive picture. However, it sometimes faces issues such as the “combination problem” (how simple experiential properties combine into the rich conscious states we experience) and risks over-attributing mental properties at every level.
  • Analytic idealism posits that mind or consciousness underlies apparent physical reality, yet it can lean toward solipsism or struggle to justify the apparent objectivity and mathematical structure inherent in modern physics.
  • Neutral monism sidesteps these problems by positing a single, non-dual underlying reality. In this view, the dichotomies (mental vs. physical) emerge contextually out of a more fundamental substance that is “neutral” with respect to our everyday categories. This avoids the pitfall of having to reduce subjective experience entirely to physical causation while also explaining the robust, shared regularities of what we call matter.

 b. Occam’s Razor and Ontological Economy:
  By assuming one kind of ultimate substance or process rather than two irreducible ones, neutral monism maintains ontological parsimony. It aims to explain the diversity of phenomena (from qualia to quarks) without extreme reification—making it an attractive candidate in terms of philosophical economy.

2. Accommodating Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

 a. Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem:
  Modern quantum mechanics reveals phenomena like non-local correlations that defy ordinary notions of space–time separation. Within a neutral monist framework, these non-local features are natural consequences of a fundamental substrate that is not bound by the emergent constraints of classical space–time. Rather than viewing the collapse of the wave function or the mysterious nature of quantum entanglement as odd exceptions, neutral monism suggests that our “physical” descriptions are emergent approximations of a richer underlying reality. The measurement problem, then, is reframed as a challenge of describing how particular modes of manifestation (which we call “observations”) arise from a holistic neutral field.

 b. Dark Matter and Dark Energy:
  The mysteries of dark matter and dark energy—ingredients that seem to dominate the gravitational landscape of the cosmos yet elude direct detection—may be reinterpreted under neutral monism as aspects of the underlying substrate that do not readily reveal themselves in our conventional material language. In other words, what we call “dark” may simply be a facet of the neutral field’s dynamics that doesn’t interact with our detectors in the ways familiar to ordinary matter and energy. This perspective encourages us to see these phenomena not as separate “exotic” substances but as part of a continuous spectrum of emergent physical behavior.

 c. The Black Hole Information Paradox:
  The unsettling idea that information might be lost in black holes has led to deep debates in quantum gravity. For neutral monism, however, the paradox often arises from our insistence on treating “information” as something that must neatly reside in discrete physical states. If, instead, all informational aspects are stored in the neutral substrate from which classical descriptions emerge, then what seems like a paradox may simply be a confusion born of our insufficient view of the underlying unity. The conversion between emergent physical states and the deeper, holistic order potentially preserves all information in ways that our current theories have yet to fully capture.

 d. New Mathematical Structures: Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes:
  Recent advances—such as the amplituhedron in scattering amplitude calculations and the study of cosmological polytopes—hint that the geometric, combinatorial, and algebraic structures underpinning our universe might be more fundamental than the traditional continuum of space and time. A neutral monist ontology naturally aligns with this line of thought. It suggests that what we perceive as “physical” geometry is but one mode of expression of the underlying, abstract neutral substance. These elegant mathematical structures might then be considered as windows into the basic organizational principles of reality, reinforcing the idea that our standard physical descriptors are emergent approximations.

3. Integrating Consciousness Science

 Consciousness research often finds itself hamstrung by the limitations of strictly materialist accounts. The experienced qualities of subjectivity—the raw feels or “qualia”—resist easy quantification in physical terms. Neutral monism offers a promising route here because it allows first-person experience and third-person physical descriptions to be seen as two aspects of the same underlying phenomenon. Instead of trying to reduce mental states to neural firings or force physical processes into a mold of subjectivity, neutral monism invites a shift in perspective: both our inner lives and the extrinsic physical world are co-manifestations of a deeper reality. This harmonization is appealing in the quest for a unified theory of both mind and matter.

4. In Summary

While no framework is without unanswered questions, neutral monism stands out because it:
 • Bridges the gap between the explanatory demands of consciousness science and the mathematical elegance of modern physics.
 • Offers a unified, parsimonious ontology that avoids the extremes of reductionist physicalism or overly expansive panpsychism.
 • Provides a conceptual space in which puzzles like quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, and the black hole information paradox may be reinterpreted not as anomalies, but as natural features of a deeper, neutral substrate.

In light of these considerations, neutral monism presents a coherent, flexible, and philosophically satisfying approach to understanding the nature of reality—one that not only respects the insights of empirical science but also leaves room for the rich and varied textures of conscious experience.
