I don’t “believe” in any view in a subjective sense, but when evaluating the strengths and challenges of different metaphysical frameworks, one promising candidate is a form of neutral monism. This view holds that what we take to be “mental” and “physical” are two ways of describing the same underlying “neutral” substance or structure. Allow me to explain why this framework is appealing from both a philosophical and a scientific standpoint.

1. Rationale for Neutral Monism

 a. Bridging the Divide:  
  Traditional physicalism runs into difficulties when trying to account for the qualitative, subjective aspects of consciousness (the so-called “hard problem”), while views that reduce everything to mind (analytic idealism) can seem counterintuitive given the robust empirical success of science. Neutral monism “splits the difference” by postulating that the ultimate building blocks of reality are neither intrinsically mental nor physical—they are neutral elements that can give rise to both. This approach admits that both the subjective aspect of experience and the objective behavior of matter are fundamental manifestations of a single kind of “stuff.”

 b. Philosophical Economy and Rigor:  
  From an analytic standpoint, neutral monism helps dissolve the hard dualisms. Instead of positing two separate realms or a strict emergence of mind from matter (or vice versa), it suggests that our categories “mental” and “physical” are emergent descriptions of a unified ontology. This aligns well with certain historical stances—from Spinoza’s monism to some interpretations of Eastern philosophies—while remaining open to rigorous conceptual analysis that modern analytic philosophy demands.

2. Accommodating Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

 a. Consciousness Science:  
  In modern attempts to understand consciousness, neither a purely physical account (e.g., reductive neural correlates) nor a wholly idealist position fully captures the richness of subjective experience. Neutral monism can potentially incorporate ideas from approaches such as integrated information theory (IIT) or more speculative quantum models of consciousness by suggesting that subjective “qualia” and objective measurements are simply distinct aspects of the same underlying reality. In this light, phenomena like phenomenal experience need not be reified as something “extra” but emerge naturally from the dynamics of a neutral substrate.

 b. Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem:  
  Quantum physics challenges our classical intuitions. Non-local correlations (as in entanglement) and the infamous measurement problem point to a reality that is not neatly separable into isolated physical parts. Within a neutral monist framework, the puzzling “collapse” of the wavefunction and the emergence of definite outcomes might be seen as processes in which the neutral substrate rearranges itself, simultaneously supporting both the informational (or proto-mental) and spatiotemporal (proto-physical) aspects. Thus, the strange behavior of quantum systems is no longer an anomaly but a hint that our foundational categories (mind/physical) inadvertently impose a dualistic reading on a more unified, underlying process.

 c. Dark Matter and Dark Energy:  
  Modern cosmology has revealed that the visible, “baryonic” matter is only a small fraction of the content of the universe. Dark matter and dark energy, which dominate its dynamics, remain elusive in terms of standard particle physics. A neutral monist perspective could encourage us to view these phenomena not as separate exotic substances but as manifestations of the same underlying neutral “stuff” that gives rise to the familiar properties of matter and spacetime under different conditions or regimes. In other words, rather than postulating entirely new “physical” entities, one might reinterpret these puzzles as clues about aspects of the neutral substrate that do not conform to our conventional labels.

 d. Black Hole Information Paradox, Amplituhedron, and Cosmological Polytopes:  
  The black hole information paradox and emerging mathematical structures—like the amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes—that arise in attempts to recast particle interactions and spacetime geometry suggest that our ordinary descriptions of spacetime and matter could be emergent from a more abstract, combinatorial or informational foundation. Neutral monism dovetails with these ideas by positing a common, underlying reality from which both geometry (and thus the gravitational field, black hole structures, etc.) and the dynamics we interpret as quantum interactions emerge. The apparent “loss” of information in black holes may be a reflection of our using mismatched descriptive scales; if both matter and mind-like properties are aspects of a single entity, consistency across scales might be restored by a more unified description.

3. Summing Up

Neutral monism, with its commitment to a unified, neutral substrate underlying both the mental and the physical, provides an attractive conceptual framework. Philosophically, it avoids the pitfalls of strict dualism and reductionism by suggesting that our two most fundamental descriptions—mental phenomena and physical behavior—are emergent patterns of a deeper reality. Empirically, it offers a way to reinterpret theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and modern physics:  
 • Quantum non-locality and the measurement problem hint at an underlying reality that is not neatly partitioned into classical particles and waves.  
 • Dark matter and dark energy may represent unfamiliar regimes of the same neutral substance.  
 • Mathematical advances like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes support the idea that spacetime itself might be emergent from a richer, more abstract structure that could well be neutral in character.

While neutral monism is not without its challenges—and many questions remain about exactly how to articulate or test its claims—it represents a promising direction for reconciling disparate strands of inquiry in both philosophy and science. In a context where our best scientific theories continually upend old dichotomies, this perspective’s flexibility in accounting for both subjective and objective features makes it a compelling candidate for a unified theory of reality.
