### Most Convincing Perspective: Neutral Monism

**Justification:**

**1. Philosophical Coherence and Flexibility**  
Neutral monism, which posits a "neutral substratum" underlying both mental and physical phenomena, offers a balanced response to the challenges of metaphysics while avoiding the extremes of physicalism or panpsychism. By dissolving the mind-matter dichotomy, it sidesteps the explanatory gap of physicalism (*e.g.,* the "hard problem" of consciousness) and the composition problem of panpsychism (how micro-consciousness aggregates into human experience). Adopting a neutral basis aligns with the scientific principle of simplicity, seeking a unified foundation for reality without privileging one domain (mind or matter) over the other.

**2. Accommodating Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem**  
Quantum non-locality (entanglement) and the measurement problem are more readily explicable within a neutral monist framework. If the neutral substratum (*e.g.,* quantum fields, spacetime geometry, or mathematical structures) inherently unites mental and physical aspects, non-local correlations can be seen as manifestations of its interconnectedness. For instance, entangled particles may share a neutral property (e.g., a shared geometric information state in the amplituhedron model) that bridges their separation. The measurement problem (collapse vs. many worlds) could be reframed as a shift in how the neutral substratum is *experienced* or *observed*, rather than requiring a physically "external" collapse. This avoids MWI's multiplicity of worlds and the subjectivity of collapse interpretations while preserving empiricism.

**3. Dark Matter/Energy as Neutral Phenomena**  
Dark matter and energy, whose gravitational effects remain unexplained by baryonic matter or known forces, could be interpreted as novel *manifestations of the neutral substratum*. Instead of assuming unknown physical particles, neutral monism allows these phenomena to arise from latent properties of the underlying unity. For example, dark energy might derive from the neutral substratum’s geometric tension (as in modified gravity theories like MOND), or dark matter could originate from non-baryonic energy fields integral to the substratum’s structure. This avoids ad hoc postulates while explaining gravitational anomalies as expressions of the neutral basis.

**4. Black Hole Information Paradox and Quantum Gravity**  
The paradox—whether information is destroyed in black holes—implies that quantum information is preserved beyond spacetime’s breakdown. Neutral monism accommodates this by treating information as fundamental to the neutral substratum (à la “it from bit” theories). If information is a primordial feature of the substratum, its persistence through black hole evaporation reflects the unity beneath spacetime’s curvature. This parallels proposals in quantum gravity where information is encoded geometrically (e.g., in spin-foam networks or the holographic principle), aligning with neutral monism’s emphasis on underlying geometric/mathematical principles.

**5. Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes as Neutral Structures**  
The amplituhedron—a geometric object calculating particle interactions without spacetime dependency—and cosmological polytopes (structures simplifying spacetime’s role in quantum gravity) suggest reality may reduce to geometric or algebraic relationships. Neutral monism harmonizes with this by framing the substratum as fundamentally algorithmic or geometrical. Consciousness could then emerge as a *different mode* of engaging with these structures, akin to how matter manifests as localized excitations of the substratum. This duality addresses both consciousness-somatic integration and high-energy physics’ deconstruction of spacetime, showing how a single framework can unify mind and matter.

**6. Overcoming Panpsychism’s Challenges**  
Unlike panpsychism, neutral monism does not require attributing consciousness to all particles (which confronts the "combination problem"). Instead, consciousness and physicality are *different realizations* of an underlying unity, allowing for graded emergence. Microphysical entities express the substratum in elemental ways, while brains assemble these components into macro-phenomena like qualia. This avoids panpsychism’s ontological overpopulation while retaining a natural route for consciousness to arise from physical processes.

**Critical Evaluation with Empirical and Theoretical Data:**  

- **Consciousness Science:** Neutral monism accommodates theories like Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which attributes consciousness to systems with maximal informational complexity, by linking such systems to structurally complex realizations of the substratum. It also avoids the "hard problem" by making consciousness and matter co-primitive, not derivative of physical processes.  
- **Quantum Physics:** The substratum’s geometric basis (e.g., via amplituhedrons) can explain entanglement without local hidden variables or infinite worlds, treating it as an emergent property of information geometry.  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** Explaining them as manifestations of the neutral substratum’s latent properties—such as spatial curvature or geometric tension—avoids reliance on undetected particles, aligning with ongoing particle physics null results.  
- **Black Holes:** Informational persistence aligns with Hawking’s later works and the firewall paradox’s need for quantum gravity effects, treated as substratum-level phenomena.  

**Conclusion:**  
Neutral monism provides a uniquely comprehensive framework, grounding both consciousness and physical theory in a unified yet open-ended substratum. It avoids the explanatory gaps of physicalism, the composition problems of panpsychism, and the idealist’s empirical challenges. By prioritizing a neutral foundation—rooted in geometry, information, or mathematical structures—it naturally encompasses quantum strangeness, cosmological mysteries, and consciousness, making it the most empirically and philosophically robust perspective. While details of the substratum’s nature (e.g., whether pure math or energy) remain open questions, its structural versatility ensures it is the most promising lens for synthesizing modern physics and consciousness studies.
