One promising framework I favor is a form of neutral monism—a view that holds that the fundamental “stuff” of reality is neither inherently mental nor purely physical but a more primitive, neutral substance that gives rise to both aspects. This position, grounded in philosophical rigor, offers a parsimonious yet expansive ontology that can potentially harmonize some of the most perplexing puzzles in both consciousness science and modern physics.

Let me explain in more detail:

1. Philosophical Rigor and Justification

 a. Bridging the Mind–Matter Divide:  
Neutral monism, unlike strict physicalism (which reduces everything to material interactions) or idealism (which relegates matter to a derivative status of the mental), posits that both mental phenomena (subjective experience, intentionality) and what we call the physical world (space, time, matter) emerge from a common, underlying substrate. Thinkers like Bertrand Russell and, more recently, proponents in the philosophy of mind have argued that a neutral base avoids the dualism’s pitfalls by not privileging one realm over the other.

 b. Conceptual Economy and Explanatory Depth:  
By not multiplying ontological categories beyond necessity, neutral monism adheres to a principle of parsimony. It suggests that the dual aspects of experience can be understood as two complementary modes of manifestation of a more basic reality. The same underlying “stuff” manifests as what we describe as physical, quantifiable properties in one context, and as qualitative, experiential phenomena in another—thus partially dissolving the “hard problem” of consciousness by reclassifying what counts as fundamental.

2. Accommodation of Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

 a. Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem:  
In quantum theory, phenomena like entanglement and non-locality hint that the conventional division between observer and system might be a derived, surface-level feature, rather than fundamental. Viewed through the lens of neutral monism, quantum systems and the observer share a common underlying reality. The “collapse” of the wave function, rather than a mysterious, discontinuous jump in physical state, may reflect a shift in the relational aspect of the neutral substrate. In this picture, measurement isn’t an external intervention on a fully objective physical system, but the engagement of a system with another aspect (e.g., the observer’s experiential side) of the same neutral base.

 b. Dark Matter and Dark Energy:  
These phenomena, which resist straightforward explanation in standard physicalist models, could be seen as emergent or residual properties of the neutral substratum. Since our instruments and theories capture only aspects of this deeper reality, it is plausible that dark matter and dark energy represent modes of organization or interaction that do not manifest in the usual “physical” observables. Neutral monism might allow us to reinterpret these enigmatic components not as additional mysterious entities, but as facets of the underlying structure that, in its full richness, encompasses more than our current physical theories capture.

 c. Black Hole Information Paradox and the Amplituhedron:  
The black hole information paradox challenges our understanding of information conservation—a foundational concept in physics. From a neutral monist viewpoint, where information, physical states, and even consciousness can be understood as expressions from a single underlying medium, the paradox could be reframed. Instead of forcing information into a strictly material account, one can see conservation laws emerging from more fundamental principles intrinsic to the neutral fabric of reality.  
Similarly, the amplituhedron—a geometric structure that in modern scattering amplitude research suggests that spacetime locality and unitarity may be emergent rather than fundamental—hints at a deeper mathematical structure underlying particle interactions. Neutral monism harmonizes with this picture: if both spacetime and matter emerge from an underlying regime (which might be best captured by such geometrical or combinatorial entities as cosmological polytopes and amplituhedra), then our conventional physical concepts are secondary descriptions supervening on a more holistic, undivided ontology.

 d. Consciousness Science:  
In consciousness science, the “explanatory gap” between physical processes and subjective experience remains a major problem. A neutral monist perspective posits that what we call mental and what we call physical are two aspects of a richer base reality. This approach opens a way to systematize the correlations we observe between neural activities and conscious states, not by reducing one to the other but by positing that both are co-manifestations of an underlying reality. It also synergizes with certain modern theories in neuroscience that emphasize network dynamics and emergent properties, suggesting that basic “proto-conscious” features might be intrinsic to the fabric of reality even at scales that do not permit high-level consciousness.

3. Overall Assessment

Neutral monism, in the way described above, offers a flexible and integrative framework. It:
 • Avoids the reductionism of strict physicalism that often underestimates subjective experience.
 • Bypasses the sometimes counterintuitive claims of strict idealism by not asserting that everything is “mind” in a traditional sense.
 • Provides a metaphysical backdrop for understanding quantum phenomena, emerging geometry (as exemplified by the amplituhedron), and cosmological puzzles (such as dark matter/dark energy) as different aspects or organizational modes of a single, neutral foundation.

While challenges remain—particularly in detailing a precise mathematical formulation of this neutral substrate that aligns fully with empirical data—it presents an intellectually appealing route for bridging diverse domains: from the micro (quantum entanglement) to the macro (cosmological structure), and from the objective (physical measurements) to the subjective (conscious experience).

In summary, while no single framework has yet offered a complete account of all these phenomena, neutral monism appears especially promising. It unifies the mind–matter divide in a way that is both conceptually economical and rich enough to potentially incorporate and illuminate some of the most significant puzzles faced by contemporary physics and the science of consciousness.
