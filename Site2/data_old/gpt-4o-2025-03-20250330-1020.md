Among the metaphysical frameworks you mentioned, **neutral monism** appears to be the most compelling perspective for explaining the nature of reality. This choice is grounded in both philosophical rigor and its ability to accommodate empirical findings across consciousness studies and contemporary physics.

### **Justification: Why Neutral Monism?**
Neutral monism posits that reality is composed of a fundamental, undifferentiated "neutral" substrate that gives rise to both mental and physical properties. Unlike **physicalism**, which struggles to explain consciousness without invoking emergentism (a problematic leap), and **panpsychism**, which faces issues in explaining how micro-conscious entities aggregate into unified macro-consciousness, neutral monism maintains a more elegant ontological economy. It avoids the pitfalls of **analytic idealism**, which renders the physical world derivative of experience in a way that struggles to account for intersubjectivity and object permanence.

Bertrand Russell and William James, among others, suggested that the fundamental constituents of reality are neither strictly mental nor strictly physical but are instead **proto-phenomenal** or **proto-physical** in nature. This perspective aligns well with contemporary physics, where reality at the most fundamental level (e.g., quantum fields, amplituhedra) appears to be described by abstract mathematical structures that do not fit neatly into a dualistic or purely physicalist ontology.

### **Empirical Alignment: Physics and Consciousness Science**
Neutral monism accommodates key empirical and theoretical puzzles in both modern physics and consciousness science:

#### **1. Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem**
   - Quantum non-locality (e.g., Bell’s theorem, entanglement) and the measurement problem suggest that the physical world does not exist in a fully definite state independently of observation. This challenges strict physicalism and suggests a deeper, underlying reality that manifests differently depending on interaction.
   - Neutral monism allows for a pre-physical reality that contains both potentialities (akin to quantum wavefunctions) and actualized states (akin to measurement outcomes). This perspective is compatible with quantum Bayesianism (QBism) and some interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., relational quantum mechanics).

#### **2. Dark Matter and Dark Energy**
   - The dominance of dark matter and dark energy—comprising over 95% of the universe's energy content—suggests that what we call "physical" is a small fraction of reality. 
   - Neutral monism, by positing a fundamental substrate beyond mere physicalism, can provide a framework for reconceptualizing these unexplained entities as manifestations of the same underlying neutral reality.

#### **3. The Black Hole Information Paradox**
   - The paradox arises from the apparent loss of quantum information in black holes, conflicting with unitarity in quantum mechanics.
   - Some solutions (e.g., holographic principle, ER=EPR) suggest that spacetime and gravity emerge from deeper entanglement-based structures. Neutral monism fits naturally with such emergentist explanations, treating spacetime itself as a high-level structure arising from a more fundamental substrate.

#### **4. The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes**
   - The amplituhedron reformulates quantum field theory in a way that eliminates traditional spacetime from fundamental physics. Cosmological polytopes extend this geometric approach to the early universe.
   - These structures suggest that fundamental reality is deeply mathematical and pre-geometric. This is more naturally interpreted through neutral monism, which allows for the possibility that what we call "matter" and "mind" are both emergent aspects of deeper informational or relational structures.

### **Conclusion: Why Not Physicalism, Idealism, or Panpsychism?**
- **Physicalism** is incomplete because it cannot explain consciousness without arbitrary emergence.
- **Analytic Idealism** struggles with intersubjectivity and treating the physical as derivative of experience.
- **Panpsychism** has difficulty explaining how small units of proto-consciousness combine into unified minds (the "combination problem").

Neutral monism, in contrast, maintains **ontological continuity** while providing a **metaphysically parsimonious** explanation of reality that aligns well with contemporary physics and consciousness science. It suggests a **fundamental, pre-physical substratum** from which both mental and physical properties arise, bridging the explanatory gaps in other frameworks.

Thus, **neutral monism** offers the most promising metaphysical perspective for a unified understanding of reality.
