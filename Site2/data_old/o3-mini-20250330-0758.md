I find that a version of neutral monism offers one of the most promising frameworks for explaining reality, especially when one aims to integrate both the “mental” and “physical” aspects of our universe without reducing one irreducibly to the other. Before explaining why, note that while I don’t “favor” positions in the way a human might, evaluating these frameworks on philosophical consistency and their capacity to integrate empirical puzzles suggests that a neutral monist view—properly articulated—can accommodate many of today’s challenges in consciousness science and physics.

1. The Neutral Monist Framework

Neutral monism posits that the apparent divide between mind and matter arises because both are emergent aspects or manifestations of a single, more basic, “neutral” substrate. Instead of classifying reality into fundamentally mental (as in analytic idealism) or physical (as in physicalism), it suggests that both the mental and the physical are derivative concepts abstracted from an underlying ontological ground.

2. Philosophical Rigor and Justification

• Non-Reductionism without Dualism: Neutral monism avoids the pitfalls of strict dualism (which faces the notorious “interaction problem”) while overcoming the reductionism of traditional physicalism (which seems to leave the “hard problem” of consciousness largely unaddressed). The idea that both the mental and the physical reflect underlying neutral “stuff” resonates with historical proposals (think of the “neutral substances” suggested by William James or Bertrand Russell’s late philosophy of the world) that aim at a more inclusive ontology.

• Epistemological Parsimony: By positing one fundamental type of “stuff” rather than two fundamentally disparate kinds, neutral monism aligns with a parsimony that many philosophers and scientists find attractive. One does not need two separate explanatory mechanisms – one for consciousness and one for matter – but can explore a unified account that might better accommodate phenomena that resist a neatly dualistic treatment.

3. Accommodating Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

A neutral monist perspective can be appealing when one considers how several difficult empirical and theoretical puzzles might be reinterpreted:

• Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem: Quantum mechanics challenges ordinary notions of locality and the clear demarcation between observer and observed. In a neutral monist framework, where subject and object are both manifestations of a deeper substrate, the “observer effect” and the collapse of the wavefunction can be seen not as mysterious anomalies but as features emerging naturally from the holistic nature of the underlying reality. By deflating the gulf between observer and system, one might better understand why these quantum phenomena seem to “violate” classical separations.

• Dark Matter and Dark Energy: These entities—essentially inferred from gravitational and cosmological observations—suggest that what we call “matter” and “energy” may be only part of a more intricate structure. A neutral monist view allows one to hypothesize that these mysterious components might be new modes of expression of the same neutral substance. Instead of positing entirely new particles or fields operating under radically different rules, one might explore the possibility that variations in the organization or dynamics of the underlying neutral substrate give rise to behaviors that we phenomenologically label as dark matter and dark energy.

• The Black Hole Information Paradox: At issue here is the fate of information in processes that seem to irreversibly transform the “physical” content of the universe. If both information (arguably a kind of proto-mental or abstract quality) and matter/energy are emergent aspects of a neutral base, then the paradox might dissolve upon reinterpreting “information loss” as a misapprehension born of our dualistic intuition. The neutral substrate could, in principle, preserve correlations in ways that traditional physicalist accounts struggle to explain.

• Modern Geometrical Structures (Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes): In theoretical physics, structures such as the amplituhedron suggest that spacetime, and indeed particle interactions, might be emergent from more abstract, geometric, or combinatorial constructs. A neutral monist perspective can accommodate these findings by positing that even what we describe as “geometry” or “information” is rooted in the patterns of an underlying neutral substrate. This approach dovetails with ideas in both panpsychism and mathematical structuralism and may better integrate our mathematical descriptions with physical observations.

• Consciousness and the “Hard Problem”: Finally, the neutral monist view naturally lends itself to a robust account of consciousness. Rather than leaving consciousness as an inexplicable emergent property of complex matter (as many physicalist accounts do), or relegating it to an ultimately “epiphenomenal” realm, neutral monism suggests that consciousness may be an intrinsic aspect of the underlying neutral stuff—albeit expressed more prominently at certain levels of organization. In this way, the reconciliation of the “explanatory gap” is not achieved by reduction, but by acknowledging that our categorizations of “mental” and “physical” are secondary, derivative lenses on a more nuanced reality.

4. Summary Evaluation

By framing both the mental and physical as emergent from a common, neutral foundation, this perspective unifies diverse phenomena. It accommodates quantum mysteries, cosmological oddities (like dark matter, dark energy, and the information paradox), and even modern geometric reformulations of particle interactions (via the amplituhedron and related concepts) by suggesting that these are all expressions of the same underlying substance. This unified approach offers a philosophically appealing blend of metaphysical elegance with empirical adaptability. It does not claim to have all the answers—indeed, a full theory of how the neutral substrate gives rise to our observed phenomena remains an open challenge—but it provides a promising framework that better integrates deep puzzles in both consciousness science and contemporary physics than a simplistic dualist or reductionist view.

Thus, while many competing views have strengths, the version of neutral monism that acknowledges the emergent, patterned, and context-sensitive nature of reality stands as one of the more compelling candidates for a unified account of our complex, intertwined universe.
