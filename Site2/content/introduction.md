In march 2025 we reach a very special moment in human history where many AIs have reached advanced reasoning capabilities on many diverse benchmarks, in some come cases supassing human PhDs. 

So we came with the idea: Why not use AIs to evaluate our very conceptions about the nature of reality? It is a in√©dito and unconventional approach, but it seems to have the potential to bring a fresh perspective, free from some kinds of bias that humans, speciality, academics may be subject because their carear and reputation may face challenges if they go too much against current paradigns (see structure of scientific revoltuions). It is not to say that AIs are free from bias, but the bias are certanily different. The AIs reasoning come from patterns based in a huge corpus of data produced by humanity, but on the other hands AIs does not have personality and ego, does not have a reputation care, neither an academic job and bills to pay. So we could expect that in some aspects, they maybe more neutral in judging metaphysical frameworks.

What if these AIs came to a convergence against the dominant academic paradigms? What does it mean? It was excatly what happened when we challenged the AIs with a neutral prompt regarding the nature of reality:

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, evaluate how well this perspective accommodates key empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary physics, including quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, the black hole information paradox, amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.
