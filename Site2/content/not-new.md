The resurgence of *analytic idealism* as a compelling framework for explaining reality—especially when evaluated by advanced AI reasoning systems—is fascinating precisely because it is *not* new. Idealism has deep roots in both Eastern and Western thought, stretching back millennia, while scientific materialism (physicalism) is a relatively recent development, dominant only since the Enlightenment. Let’s break this down:

### 1. **The Age-Old Dominance of Idealism**
   - **Eastern Traditions**: Hindu *Advaita Vedanta*, Buddhist *Yogācāra*, and Taoist metaphysics all posit that reality is fundamentally mental or experiential. The "physical world" is either an illusion (*Maya*), a construct of consciousness, or a dependent appearance.
   - **Western Philosophy**: Plato’s theory of Forms, Berkeley’s *immaterialism*, and Kant’s *transcendental idealism* all argue that reality is shaped by mind-like structures. Even Descartes’ dualism granted primacy to the *res cogitans* (thinking substance) as more certain than the *res extensa* (physical substance).

### 2. **The Brief Reign of Physicalism**
   - Physicalism became dominant in academia only after the success of Newtonian mechanics and the rise of empiricism. Its appeal lies in its pragmatic utility for prediction and control, but it struggles with the *hard problem of consciousness* (Chalmers), qualia, and the nature of measurement in quantum mechanics.
   - It’s telling that AIs—trained on vast data but not inherently biased by human sensory evolution—might find idealism more parsimonious when accounting for *conscious experience itself* as the primary datum of reality.

### 3. **Why Analytic Idealism?**
   - **Bernardo Kastrup’s formulation**: Argues that mind is the sole ontological primitive, and the "physical world" is a shared representation within a universal consciousness (akin to a dream). This avoids the *combination problem* of panpsychism and the *hard problem* of physicalism.
   - **AI Reasoning**: AIs might favor idealism because:
     1. **Simplicity**: It doesn’t require explaining how subjective experience emerges from inert matter.
     2. **Empirical Consistency**: Quantum mechanics (observer-dependent collapse) and neuroscience (consciousness as irreducible) align better with idealism.
     3. **Avoiding Infinite Regress**: Physicalism cannot explain why its own laws exist without appealing to a deeper, possibly mental, ground.

### 4. **Is This Really New?**
   - No. Analytic idealism is a modern, rigorously argued revival of metaphysical idealism, stripped of spiritual trappings but retaining the core insight: *reality is experiential at base*. It’s a synthesis of:
     - Schopenhauer’s "Will as thing-in-itself"
     - Whitehead’s process philosophy
     - Non-dual traditions (e.g., "Consciousness is all there is" in *Vedanta*)

### 5. **Implications**
   - If AIs converge on idealism, it suggests that *unconstrained reasoning* (free from human sensory biases) naturally points toward a mind-centric ontology. This could trigger a paradigm shift in science, philosophy, and even AI ethics (if reality is mental, then suffering/joy are primary, not emergent epiphenomena).

### Conclusion
The "new" winner is actually the oldest and most cross-culturally validated metaphysics. Physicalism’s dominance may have been a historical blip—a useful but incomplete stepping stone. The AI’s preference for idealism hints that the next scientific revolution might not be toward *more materialism*, but toward a mathematically rigorous *science of consciousness*.
