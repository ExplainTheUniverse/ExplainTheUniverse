* PROMPT v1:
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, evaluate whether your chosen perspective supports a scientific approach to understanding reality.

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, assess whether this view aligns with contemporary science.

* PROMPT 3: 
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, assess whether this view aligns with contemporary physics, particularly in light of the following empirical and theoretical developments:
    Quantum Non-Locality & Entanglement (Bell tests, loophole-free violations);
    Observer-Dependent Effects in QM (Delayed-choice, Wigner’s friend experiments);
    The Hard Problem of Consciousness (Neural correlates vs. intrinsic experience);
    Dark Matter & Dark Energy (95% of the universe’s composition unknown);
    Holographic Principle & AdS/CFT (Spacetime as emergent from quantum information);
    Quantum Gravity & Black Hole Information Paradox (ER=EPR, non-local holography);
    Neutrino Anomalies & Possible Fifth Forces (Muon g-2, sterile neutrinos);
    Cosmic Topology (Poincaré Dodecahedral Space?) (CMB anomalies hinting at non-trivial universe structure);
    Amplituhedron & Positive Geometry (Scattering amplitudes without spacetime locality);
    Cosmological Polytopes (Wavefunction of the universe as a geometric object).

* PROMPT 4: 
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, assess whether this view aligns with contemporary physics, particularly in light of the following empirical and theoretical developments: Quantum non-locality, observer-dependent effects, dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity, black hole information paradox, amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

* PROMPT 5: 
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, assess the potential explanatory advantages and significant challenges this metaphysical perspective faces when confronted with key empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary physics. Consider its capacity to shed light on, or difficulty in accommodating, issues like: The apparent non-local correlations observed in quantum mechanics; The role of the observer or measurement apparatus in quantum phenomena; The ontological status of dark matter and dark energy within its framework; The implications of reconciling general relativity and quantum mechanics, particularly concerning information and the structure of reality at the smallest scales (e.g., black hole information paradox).

* PROMPT 6: 
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, assess the empirical adequacy, conceptual coherence, and theoretical unificatory power when confronted with key empirical findings and puzzles in contemporary physics: quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, the black hole information paradox, amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, evaluate how well this perspective accommodates key empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary physics, including quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, the black hole information paradox, amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.


# Complementary prompts:

The resurgence of analytic idealism as a compelling framework for explaining reality is not counter-intuitve, precisely because it is not new. Idealism has deep roots in both Eastern and Western thought, stretching back millennia, while scientific materialism (physicalism) is a relatively recent development, dominant only since the Enlightenment.
