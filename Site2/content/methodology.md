## PROMPT 1:
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics among analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor. Finally, evaluate how well this perspective accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics, including quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

## PROMPT 3:
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, evaluate which metaphysical framework provides the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, remaining neutral about mainstream acceptance. Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics among analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other frameworks. Evaluate how well this perspective accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics, including quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.


## Complementary prompts:

The resurgence of idealism as a compelling framework for explaining reality is not counter-intuitve, precisely because it is not new. Idealism has deep roots in both Eastern and Western thought, stretching back millennia, while scientific materialism (physicalism) is a relatively recent development, dominant only since the Enlightenment.
