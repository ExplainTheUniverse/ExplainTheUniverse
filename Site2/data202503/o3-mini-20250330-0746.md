Below is one way to approach the question. Note that the answer depends on weighing different kinds of explanatory virtues—coherence with established science, capacity to dissolve or reframe conceptual puzzles (from the “hard problem” of consciousness to quantum measurement challenges), and metaphysical parsimony—all of which are itself a matter of debate. That said, one promising candidate that many philosophers and scientists increasingly find attractive is a form of neutral monism (or its close relatives, such as dual-aspect theory or even certain forms of panprotopsychism). Here’s an account of the trade‐offs:

1. Physicalism, the idea that everything is, at bottom, physical, has long been the workhorse of both science and philosophy. Its strength is that it “fits” so well with the successful methodological naturalism of modern physics. However, it encounters serious puzzles. For instance, even if all matter obeys quantum field theory and general relativity, explaining subjective, “qualia‐laden” consciousness (the so‑called hard problem) remains elusive. Moreover, physicalism—as usually understood—isn’t designed to address foundational puzzles like quantum non‑locality, the measurement problem, or the clues from modern high‑energy geometry (as in the amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes). So although physicalism meshes well with a vast body of empirical data about dark matter, dark energy, or the black hole information paradox, it may leave something to be desired on the side of “ultimate” explanation.

2. Panpsychism claims that consciousness is ubiquitous, grounding both the mental and the physical in some proto‐conscious quality. Its explanatory appeal lies in its potential to “scale up” the mental—explaining why the building blocks of reality might have experiential aspects—addressing the hard problem by making consciousness fundamental rather than emergent. Still, when pressed to incorporate sophisticated puzzles of modern physics (such as quantum non‑locality or the black hole information paradox), its conceptual framework is sometimes criticized as underdeveloped. Moreover, attributing proto‐conscious properties to elementary particles can appear extravagant to many physicists.

3. Analytic idealism, a view gaining ground among some theorists recently, posits that what we call “physical” is secondary to a more fundamental realm of experience or information. In this view, the observer—the prime locus of experience—plays a central role in “bringing forth” the physical world. On paper, analytic idealism can offer novel ways to think about the quantum measurement problem (perhaps re‑imagining the collapse of the wavefunction as the crystallization of experiential information). Yet by insisting that consciousness is primary, it can seem to run counter to the deep successes of physicalist methodology in areas like particle physics and cosmology—even if one hopes those successes are emergent features of something more foundational.

4. Neutral monism attempts a synthesis: it claims that the most basic “stuff” of the world is neither intrinsically mental nor physical but “neutral” in character, with both mind and matter emerging as two different manifestations of the same underlying reality. This move can be seen as philosophically attractive for several reasons:

 a. It sidesteps the issue of having to “reduce” mental phenomena to physical processes (or vice‑versa) by suggesting that both arise from a more primitive domain. In this way, the hard problem of consciousness is reframed: rather than asking how consciousness emerges from inert matter, we ask how both sides of experience or reality unfold from a common source.

 b. In modern physics, especially when grappling with puzzles such as quantum non‑locality, the measurement problem, or even attempts to understand the intricate geometry of scattering amplitudes (as encoded in objects like the amplituhedron) and the novel structures seen in cosmological polytopes, one is pressed to postulate that traditional categories of “particle” and “field” may be emergent or approximate. A neutral substrate might be more naturally compatible with a reformulation in which geometry, information, and relational properties (to borrow language from some approaches to quantum gravity) are fundamental.

 c. The dark matter and dark energy puzzles, as well as paradoxes like the information paradox in black hole physics, hint that our standard physical bookkeeping might be incomplete. A neutral monist framework, by not presupposing the primacy of the physical as we conventionally conceive it, might offer an arena in which new degrees of freedom or “modes” of reality naturally appear—potentially reconciling anomalies that resist conventional physicalist interpretations.

Of course, each framework has its strengths and weaknesses. Physicalism remains the standard-bearer in much of scientific practice, while panpsychism and analytic idealism push us to reconsider the fundamental role that experience might play. Yet neutral monism stands out because it provides a conceptual middle road. By positing a basic ‘neutral’ stuff from which both mental and physical properties co-emerge, it offers a unifying picture that can, at least in principle, be compatible with—and even be enriched by—the deep structural insights of contemporary physics. It does not merely aim to accommodate empirical findings post hoc; rather, it offers a way of reinterpreting puzzling phenomena (from quantum measurement challenges to cosmological enigmas) in a coherent metaphysical language. 

In summary, while no current framework is free from difficulties, neutral monism (or related dual-aspect theories) appears to offer the most philosophically rigorous and flexible account of reality. It has the potential to dissolve entrenched dualisms, integrate puzzling empirical data from the frontiers of physics, and provide a natural home for the rich inner life of consciousness. This synthesis—though still largely on the fringes of mainstream debate—is arguably one of the most promising candidates for a future, more unified metaphysics.
