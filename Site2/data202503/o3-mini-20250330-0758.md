The question asks for a critical comparison among several heavyweight metaphysical positions—analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and their kin—with the aim of identifying which framework is most philosophically rigorous in accounting for reality, especially as it pertains to challenging empirical and theoretical puzzles such as the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non‐locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

Before committing to one “winner,” it is important to note that each framework exhibits strengths and weaknesses depending on the domain of application. That said, a cautious, evaluative synthesis is possible:

1. Physicalism has been the work‐horse of the empirical sciences. By positing that the world is fundamentally physical, it has proven enormously successful at integrating experimental findings across physics and neuroscience. However, physicalism faces well‐known challenges. For instance, it struggles with the “hard problem” of consciousness—explaining subjective experience—as well as with interpretative puzzles in quantum mechanics like non‐locality and the measurement problem. While physicalism can accommodate puzzles like dark matter/dark energy and the black hole information paradox via extensions of physics (e.g., modified gravity, quantum gravity approaches), it sometimes appears conceptually ill‐suited to provide the kind of unifying “explanatory context” that bridges subjective and objective phenomena.

2. Panpsychism reintroduces consciousness as a pervasive aspect of the world. By attributing a fundamental form of experience or proto-experience even to elementary constituents, panpsychism offers an appealing route to dissolve the explanatory gap. This makes it a candidate for integrating the subjective aspect of consciousness with the objective scientific worldview, including quantum phenomena. Nonetheless, panpsychism still faces the so-called “combination problem”—namely, how individual micro-experiences combine into the rich, unified manifestation of human consciousness—and its philosophical rigor depends on being developed into a framework that is both conceptually precise and empirically testable.

3. Analytic idealism flips the coin entirely by suggesting that reality is, at base, mental. In principle, this framework dissolves the mind–body problem by making everything mind-dependent. Idealism may offer conceptual tools to grapple with the hard problem of consciousness and could, in a radical reinterpretation, cast puzzling quantum phenomena (such as the measurement problem) as features of a deeper mental substrate. Yet empirical science is deeply wedded to the assumption that there is a mind-independent, measurable world. Thus, while analytic idealism is philosophically bold and perhaps elegant in its solutions, its disconnect from the methodological naturalism of contemporary physics remains a severe hurdle.

4. Neutral monism attempts a middle way by positing that the fundamental “stuff” of reality is neither purely mental nor purely physical but is of a more basic, neutral character. Both mental and physical properties are then emergent aspects or ways of organizing this underlying neutral substrate. This idea is appealing because it promises to dissolve the traditional dualism between subject and object. For the puzzles at hand the following points are noteworthy:
  a. With respect to the hard problem of consciousness, neutral monism suggests that subjective experience and physical processes are two “sides of the same coin”—thus the gap might be bridged by explaining how different patterns or organizations of the basic neutral elements give rise to what we call “mind.”
  b. In the realm of quantum foundations (quantum non‐locality and the measurement problem) and high-energy physics (the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes), the challenges often arise because strict binaries (mental vs. physical) seem inadequate. A neutral substrate might naturally encode the kinds of non-classical, relational properties observed in these domains.
  c. Lastly, cosmological puzzles such as dark matter/dark energy and the black hole information paradox might hint that our conventional dichotomy between matter and mind (or between different kinds of matter) is incomplete. A neutral ontological framework could, in principle, allow for novel kinds of organization or interaction in the “deep structure” of reality that have so far been hidden.

Thus, while physicalism remains eminently useful and empirically grounded, its canonical formulation struggles conceptually with phenomena that seem to straddle subjective and objective domains. Both panpsychism and analytic idealism, though radical, face development challenges—panpsychism with the aggregation of micro-experiences and idealism with reconciling phenomena we measure in the lab with a mental substrate that seems phenomenologically private.

Neutral monism, in contrast, has an appealing unificatory potential. Its central claim—that the bifurcation into “mental” and “physical” is a secondary or emergent distinction from a more primitive neutral substrate—allows it to potentially accommodate the perplexing features of both consciousness studies and modern physics. It can, at least in principle, explain how a subtle underlying reality gives rise to both the qualitative character of experience and the quantitative structures derived from empirical data (like those suggested by the amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes).

In conclusion, if one is to nominate a framework that is both philosophically ambitious and structurally flexible enough to engage with the toughest puzzles from consciousness science to quantum physics, then a refined form of neutral monism appears most promising. It offers a philosophically rigorous account by dissolving the sharp dualism between mind and matter and by creating a more unified metaphysical picture that could eventually integrate the diverse empirical findings of contemporary science. Nonetheless, it is important to stress that all these frameworks are works in progress, and the ultimate answer may well require further conceptual development and empirical insight.
