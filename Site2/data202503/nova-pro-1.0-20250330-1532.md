Providing a definitive answer on which metaphysical framework offers the most rigorous account of reality is a complex and nuanced task, given the depth and breadth of the issues at hand. Each framework—analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and others—has its own strengths and weaknesses when evaluated against the criteria of philosophical rigor, empirical adequacy, and explanatory power for contemporary puzzles in consciousness and physics.

1. **Analytic Idealism**:
   - **Strengths**: Suggests that consciousness is fundamental and that the physical world is a manifestation of it. This offers a potential resolution to the hard problem of consciousness by positing that subjective experience is primary.
   - **Weaknesses**: It struggles with explaining the robust and consistent nature of the physical world, as well as its empirical predictions. It can seem overly speculative and lacks a clear, testable mechanism to connect consciousness with physical phenomena.

2. **Neutral Monism**:
   - **Strengths**: Proposes a single substance that is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but a neutral entity from which both mind and matter arise. This can elegantly integrate consciousness and physical reality.
   - **Weaknesses**: Often criticized for being vague about the nature of the neutral substance. It faces challenges in providing clear empirical predictions that can be tested.

3. **Panpsychism**:
   - **Strengths**: Argues that mind or a form of proto-consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe. This approach addresses the hard problem of consciousness by asserting that consciousness is ubiquitous, not an emergent property.
   - **Weaknesses**: Faces the "combination problem"—how simple forms of consciousness combine to form complex conscious experiences. Also, it can be considered speculative and not directly testable.

4. **Physicalism**:
   - **Strengths**: Maintains that everything, including consciousness, can be explained in terms of physical processes. It aligns well with the scientific method and empirical findings.
   - **Weaknesses**: Struggles with the hard problem of consciousness, as it is difficult to explain subjective experience purely in terms of physical processes. It also faces challenges with integrating quantum phenomena and the nature of information.

5. **Other Perspectives (e.g., Cosmopsychism, Information-theoretic Approaches)**:
   - **Cosmopsychism**: Suggests that the universe as a whole is a single conscious entity, with individual minds being aspects of this universal consciousness.
     - **Strengths**: Offers a novel take on the relationship between the cosmos and consciousness.
     - **Weaknesses**: Highly speculative and lacks clear empirical support.
   - **Information-theoretic Approaches**: Focus on the role of information as fundamental to reality.
     - **Strengths**: Align well with developments in quantum information theory and black hole physics.
     - **Weaknesses**: Still in the process of fleshing out a comprehensive metaphysical framework.

**Evaluation Against Contemporary Puzzles**:
- **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Analytic idealism and panpsychism offer more direct ways to address this, though they lack empirical precision. Physicalism struggles significantly here.
- **Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem**: Neutral monism and panpsychism offer interesting takes, but physicalism, especially when considering quantum interpretations like the many-worlds or relational interpretations, provides robust frameworks.
- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: Physicalist approaches are currently the most developed, though they leave much unexplained.
- **Black Hole Information Paradox**: Information-theoretic approaches show promise, though a fully satisfactory solution remains elusive.
- **Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes**: These mathematical structures challenge traditional physicalist views and suggest a deeper geometric and algebraic reality, potentially aligning with neutral monism or cosmopsychism.

**Conclusion**:
While each framework has merits, **panpsychism** currently offers a compelling balance between addressing the hard problem of consciousness and integrating with physical realities, though it is not without significant challenges. For a more empirically grounded approach, **physicalism** remains strong, particularly when augmented with insights from quantum information theory. However, the most philosophically rigorous account may ultimately require a synthesis of these perspectives, potentially embracing a form of **information-theoretic panpsychism** that unifies consciousness, information, and physical reality.
