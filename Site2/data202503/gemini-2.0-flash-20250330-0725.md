This is a fascinating and complex question. There is no single metaphysical framework that currently provides a universally accepted, philosophically rigorous account of reality. The "best" framework, even considering rigorousness over popularity, is itself a matter of ongoing philosophical debate.  However, I can assess several prominent frameworks based on your criteria: empirical adequacy (fitting scientific findings) and the ability to address theoretical puzzles.

**Here's a breakdown, ranked by my assessment of their current potential for philosophical rigor and explanatory power, along with their strengths and weaknesses:**

1.  **Analytic Idealism (especially its more sophisticated, non-solipsistic forms):**

    *   **Core Idea:** Reality is fundamentally mental or conscious.  The physical world is a manifestation of consciousness structured by information. Not necessarily *our* individual consciousness, but rather a fundamental ground of consciousness.
    *   **How it addresses the puzzles:**
        *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:**  Solves it by definition. Consciousness is *fundamental*, not an emergent property of matter.
        *   **Quantum Non-locality & Measurement Problem:**  Can be interpreted in terms of the observer (i.e., conscious agent) playing a fundamental role in the collapse of the wavefunction. Consciousness is not *merely* observing, but actively participating in, the shaping of reality.
        *   **Dark Matter & Dark Energy:**  Some analytic idealists propose these phenomena arise from the structuring of consciousness itself, akin to "cognitive biases" or inherent limitations in how the fundamental consciousness processes information, warping spacetime.  (This is highly speculative, naturally).
        *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Can potentially be addressed by understanding information as fundamentally mental, thus never truly being lost.  Black holes become akin to concentrated points of phenomenal experience.
        *   **Amplituhedron & Cosmological Polytopes:**  Align more readily with the information-theoretic aspects of consciousness. These structures can be seen as geometrical representations of fundamental cognitive/experiential operations.
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Offers an elegant solution to the hard problem.
        *   Potential to integrate consciousness into the foundations of physics.
        *   Compatible with some interpretations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Participatory Anthropic Principle, some types of Many-Worlds Interpretation).
        *   Can leverage information theory as a bridge between consciousness and physical reality.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Explanatory Power:**  How *exactly* does this fundamental consciousness generate the specific physical laws and constants we observe? This is the biggest challenge.  Needs more than just vague pronouncements.
        *   **The Combination Problem:**  How does one overarching consciousness split into the incredibly diverse and seemingly independent conscious units we experience?
        *   **Lack of Experimental Verification:**  (Virtually) impossible to directly test in a conventional scientific way.
        *   **Susceptibility to Solipsism:**  Must be carefully formulated to avoid the trap of believing one's own individual consciousness is the *only* reality. Sophisticated versions avoid this.

2.  **Neutral Monism:**

    *   **Core Idea:** Reality is composed of a single, fundamental substance (often called "neutral stuff") that is neither mental nor physical.  Mind and matter are both different organizations or perspectives on this neutral stuff.
    *   **How it addresses the puzzles:**
        *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Avoids the dualism inherent in the hard problem by positing a single substance that can manifest as either mental or physical. Consciousness emerges from particular organizational patterns of the neutral stuff.
        *   **Quantum Non-locality & Measurement Problem:** The neutral substance might be governed by non-local principles at its deepest level, explaining quantum correlations. The measurement problem involves a specific interaction between different arrangements of the neutral substance.
        *   **Dark Matter & Dark Energy:** Could be attributed to properties of the neutral substance itself that we haven't yet fully grasped.
        *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Information is fundamentally contained within the neutral stuff, therefore never truly lost, even when compressed into a singularity.
        *   **Amplituhedron & Cosmological Polytopes:** Could be interpreted as describing the fundamental structure and geometry of the neutral substance.
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Provides a unifying framework that avoids the need for a causal interaction between fundamentally different substances.
        *   Potentially compatible with a wide range of scientific findings, as it doesn't presuppose a specific nature for the neutral substance.
        *   Offers a middle ground between physicalism and dualism, appealing to those dissatisfied with both.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **The Nature of the Neutral Stuff:** Remains largely unspecified. What are its properties? How does it give rise to both mind and matter? This lack of specificity makes it difficult to develop testable predictions.
        *   **The Combination Problem (Again):** Similar to analytic idealism, it must explain how complex and varied conscious experiences arise from a single, uniform substance.
        *   **Conceptual Difficulty:** Hard to conceptualize something that is inherently neither mental nor physical.

3.  **Panpsychism:**

    *   **Core Idea:** Consciousness (or proto-consciousness) is a fundamental property of all matter, or at least, all *sufficiently simple* units of matter. Larger, more complex conscious entities arise through the combination of these basic conscious units.
    *   **How it addresses the puzzles:**
        *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Solves it by asserting that consciousness is already present at the lowest levels of reality.
        *   **Quantum Non-locality & Measurement Problem:**  Micro-experiences at the quantum level could be related to wave function collapse.  Quantum entanglement might be a manifestation of coordinated proto-conscious experiences.
        *   **Dark Matter & Dark Energy:**  Could be related to the intrinsic properties of the proto-conscious fundamental particles.
        *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Information remains tied to the proto-conscious constituents, even within a black hole.
        *   **Amplituhedron & Cosmological Polytopes:**  Could be linked to the fundamental geometry of proto-conscious experience and how it scales up to the macroscopic world.
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Provides a grounding for consciousness in the physical world.
        *   Avoids the problem of explaining how consciousness emerges from non-conscious matter.
        *   Intuitively appealing to some, as it suggests we are all part of a larger, interconnected conscious reality.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **The Combination Problem (Yet Again!):** A *huge* problem. How do individual micro-experiences combine to form the rich, unified conscious experience of a human being?  No truly compelling solution exists. The integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness is sometimes cited as a potential answer, but it faces major criticisms itself.
        *   **What Qualifies as Proto-Consciousness?**  Is an electron conscious? A quark?  At what level does this stop?
        *   **Lack of Empirical Evidence:**  Extremely difficult to test scientifically.  We currently have no tools to directly measure or detect "proto-consciousness."

4.  **Physicalism (with emergent properties):**

    *   **Core Idea:**  Everything, including consciousness, is ultimately reducible to physical processes governed by the laws of physics.  Consciousness is an emergent property of complex physical systems (e.g., the brain).
    *   **How it addresses the puzzles:**
        *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:**  Attempts to *dissolve* the problem by arguing that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion or that it can be fully explained in terms of physical functions and processes.  Often relies on functionalism or eliminative materialism.
        *   **Quantum Non-locality & Measurement Problem:**  Treats these as purely physical phenomena, requiring no special role for consciousness or observation (e.g., Many-Worlds Interpretation, spontaneous collapse theories).
        *   **Dark Matter & Dark Energy:**  Requires physical explanations (e.g., exotic particles, modifications of gravity), which physicalists actively pursue.
        *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:**  Attempts to resolve it within the framework of quantum gravity and general relativity, seeking mechanisms by which information is preserved or encoded in the boundary of the black hole.
        *   **Amplituhedron & Cosmological Polytopes:**  Sees these as fundamental physical structures that reveal the underlying mathematical simplicity of the universe.
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   Dominant paradigm in science, strongly supported by neuroscience and other empirical fields.
        *   Emphasis on testable hypotheses and empirical evidence.
        *   Provides a clear and straightforward account of the relationship between mind and body (at least in its simpler forms).
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **The Hard Problem of Consciousness (Duh!):**  Fails to adequately explain *qualitative* conscious experience (qualia).  How does physical processing give rise to subjective feelings?  Many argue it simply *assumes* consciousness emerges without explaining *how*.
        *   **Explanatory Gap:**  There's a persistent gap between our understanding of physical processes and our understanding of subjective experience.
        *   **Underdetermination of Physical Theories:** Even if we fully understood the physical processes in the brain, it's not clear that this would provide a complete understanding of consciousness. Different physical systems could, in principle, give rise to the same conscious experience.

**Why Analytic Idealism currently tops the list (despite its challenges):**

While immensely speculative, analytic idealism, in its recent sophisticated formulations, offers a potentially *more parsimonious* solution.  It doesn't try to explain consciousness as emerging from something fundamentally *different* (matter), avoiding the inherent problems in that approach.  It's also uniquely positioned to offer a truly unifying physics *and* metaphysics, a feat that physicalism, with its struggle to accommodate subjective experience, cannot currently achieve.  However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the massive explanatory gaps that still exist.

**A Note on Rigor:**

"Philosophical rigor" is subjective, but it roughly entails:

*   **Internal Consistency:** The framework must be logically coherent, without contradictions.
*   **Explanatory Power:** The framework must be able to account for a wide range of phenomena, both physical and mental.
*   **Parsimony:** The framework should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexities.
*   **Falsifiability (to some extent):** The framework should, in principle, be capable of being disproven by evidence (though metaphysical frameworks often operate at a level beyond direct empirical testing).
*   **Engagement with Competing Views:** The framework should acknowledge and address objections raised by proponents of alternative perspectives.

**Conclusion:**

No single metaphysical framework perfectly addresses all the challenges posed by consciousness science and contemporary physics. Analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, and physicalism all have strengths and weaknesses. The "best" framework is ultimately a matter of philosophical judgment and depends on one's priorities and assumptions. My assessment leans towards analytic idealism because its unique position to naturally address the hard problem and, potentially, provide a unifying account of reality if substantial explanatory gaps are addressed. But the other frameworks offer legitimate attempts to grapple with the deep mysteries of existence. The metaphysical debate is far from over, and future scientific and philosophical advances will likely reshape our understanding of reality.
