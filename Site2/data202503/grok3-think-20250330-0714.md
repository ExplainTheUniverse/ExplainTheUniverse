To determine which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, I will evaluate analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other relevant perspectives. Philosophical rigor here implies internal consistency, the ability to accommodate empirical findings, and explanatory power for theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics. The key issues to consider include the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes. I will assess each framework systematically, regardless of mainstream acceptance, as requested.

### **Overview of Metaphysical Frameworks**

- **Physicalism**: This posits that everything is physical, and all facts are reducible to physical facts. It aligns closely with empirical science but faces challenges in explaining non-physical phenomena like consciousness.
- **Panpsychism**: This suggests that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, present even in basic entities like particles. It aims to address consciousness directly but introduces new complexities.
- **Neutral Monism**: This holds that reality’s fundamental nature is neither mental nor physical but a neutral substance that underlies both. It seeks a middle ground but often lacks specificity.
- **Analytic Idealism**: A form of idealism asserting that reality is fundamentally mental, with the physical world as a manifestation of mental processes. It offers a unified approach to consciousness and physics.
- **Other Frameworks**: I will briefly consider alternatives like dual-aspect monism, process philosophy, and informational metaphysics to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

### **Evaluation Against Key Issues**

#### **1. The Hard Problem of Consciousness**
The hard problem asks how and why subjective experience arises from physical processes.

- **Physicalism**: Struggles significantly here. It attempts to reduce consciousness to brain processes, but no consensus exists on how physical states produce subjective experience, leaving a persistent explanatory gap.
- **Panpsychism**: Addresses this by making consciousness fundamental, even at the micro-level. However, it faces the *combination problem*: how do micro-conscious entities combine into macro-level experiences like human consciousness? This remains unresolved.
- **Neutral Monism**: Proposes that a neutral substance underlies both mental and physical phenomena, potentially sidestepping the hard problem. Yet, it lacks clarity on how this neutral basis generates subjective experience, rendering it vague.
- **Analytic Idealism**: By positing consciousness as the foundation of reality, it dissolves the hard problem—subjective experience is primary, not derivative. The challenge shifts to explaining how the physical emerges from the mental, which it addresses conceptually by viewing the physical as a representation of mental processes.

#### **2. Quantum Non-Locality**
Quantum non-locality, exemplified by entanglement, suggests instantaneous correlations across distances, challenging classical locality.

- **Physicalism**: Accommodates this within quantum mechanics via interpretations like many-worlds or hidden variables. While empirically consistent, these interpretations introduce complexity or unresolved questions (e.g., what selects a world?).
- **Panpsychism**: Offers no direct resolution unless it links consciousness to quantum processes (e.g., collapse), which is speculative and not inherent to the framework.
- **Neutral Monism**: Could interpret non-locality as a property of the neutral substance, but without a detailed mechanism, this remains abstract.
- **Analytic Idealism**: Views quantum phenomena as manifestations of a unified mental reality. Non-locality reflects the interconnectedness of this mental realm, providing a coherent, if unconventional, explanation.

#### **3. The Measurement Problem**
This concerns why and how quantum wave functions collapse upon measurement.

- **Physicalism**: Relies on interpretations like decoherence (collapse via environmental interaction) or objective collapse theories. These are mathematically rigorous but philosophically debated, as they don’t fully explain the transition from probabilities to definite states.
- **Panpsychism**: Some versions suggest consciousness causes collapse (e.g., von Neumann-Wigner), but this is controversial and lacks empirical support.
- **Neutral Monism**: Might propose that measurement reflects an interaction within the neutral substance, but this is underdeveloped and speculative.
- **Analytic Idealism**: Suggests measurement is an interaction within the mental realm, eliminating the need for an external collapse mechanism. The physical world’s appearance of collapse emerges from mental processes, offering a novel resolution.

#### **4. Dark Matter and Dark Energy**
These explain gravitational effects and cosmic expansion but remain physically unidentified.

- **Physicalism**: Treats them as physical entities or modifications to gravity (e.g., MOND). It integrates them into cosmology but lacks direct detection, leaving their nature open.
- **Panpsychism**: Has no specific stance unless it ties consciousness to these phenomena, which it typically doesn’t.
- **Neutral Monism**: Could view them as manifestations of the neutral substance, but this adds little explanatory value without specifics.
- **Analytic Idealism**: Might interpret them as structural aspects of the mental reality manifesting physically. While lacking predictive detail, it aligns them with a broader metaphysical narrative.

#### **5. The Black Hole Information Paradox**
This questions whether information is lost in black holes, challenging physical principles.

- **Physicalism**: Tackles this via quantum gravity (e.g., string theory, holography), suggesting information is preserved. Progress exists, but the paradox remains unresolved.
- **Panpsychism**: Offers no direct insight unless consciousness relates to information, which is not standard.
- **Neutral Monism**: Could speculate that information persists in the neutral substance, but this is vague.
- **Analytic Idealism**: Posits information as fundamentally mental, not physical, potentially resolving the paradox by redefining information’s substrate. This is speculative but consistent with its premises.

#### **6. The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes**
These mathematical structures simplify quantum and cosmological calculations, hinting at a deeper reality.

- **Physicalism**: Incorporates them as tools describing physical laws, aligning with its mathematical rigor but not altering its ontology.
- **Panpsychism**: Could interpret them as reflecting a conscious universe, though this is peripheral to its core claims.
- **Neutral Monism**: Might see them as expressions of the neutral substance, but this lacks development.
- **Analytic Idealism**: Views them as geometric structures of the mental realm, potentially unifying their significance with consciousness and physics.

### **Comparative Assessment**

- **Physicalism**:
  - *Strengths*: Highly developed, aligns with empirical science, and excels in explaining physical phenomena.
  - *Weaknesses*: Fails to resolve the hard problem and relies on contested interpretations for quantum issues.
  - *Rigour*: Strong in consistency and empirical fit but incomplete in explanatory scope.

- **Panpsychism**:
  - *Strengths*: Directly tackles consciousness by making it fundamental.
  - *Weaknesses*: The combination problem undermines its coherence, and it lacks integration with physics puzzles.
  - *Rigour*: Conceptually bold but less comprehensive and speculative in application.

- **Neutral Monism**:
  - *Strengths*: Offers a unifying potential by avoiding dualism.
  - *Weaknesses*: Too abstract, lacking concrete mechanisms for empirical or theoretical issues.
  - *Rigour*: Philosophically intriguing but insufficiently developed.

- **Analytic Idealism**:
  - *Strengths*: Unifies consciousness and physical phenomena under a mental ontology, resolving the hard problem and offering fresh perspectives on quantum and cosmological issues.
  - *Weaknesses*: Less empirically tested and requires further development to match physicalism’s detail in physics.
  - *Rigour*: Internally consistent, broad in explanatory ambition, and adaptable to diverse puzzles.

### **Consideration of Alternatives**

- **Dual-Aspect Monism**: Similar to neutral monism, it posits a single reality with mental and physical aspects. It addresses consciousness but struggles with specificity for physics puzzles.
- **Process Philosophy (Whitehead)**: Views reality as processes integrating consciousness and physicality. It’s rich but complex and less focused on contemporary physics.
- **Informational Metaphysics**: Suggests reality is fundamentally information. It aligns with mathematical structures but falters on consciousness unless combined with other views.
- **Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (Tegmark)**: Posits reality as mathematical, excelling with structures like the amplituhedron but neglecting consciousness.

### **Conclusion**

Among the frameworks, **analytic idealism** stands out as the most philosophically rigorous. It provides a unified account by making consciousness fundamental, dissolving the hard problem, and reinterpreting physical phenomena (e.g., quantum non-locality, measurement) as manifestations of a mental reality. While physicalism excels in empirical alignment, its failure with consciousness limits its scope. Panpsychism and neutral monism offer partial solutions but lack the breadth and specificity of analytic idealism. Alternatives like process philosophy or informational metaphysics are compelling but less developed for this context.

Analytic idealism’s strength lies in its internal consistency and potential to address both consciousness and physics, even if it requires further elaboration to rival physicalism’s empirical depth. Given the query’s emphasis on rigor over mainstream acceptance, analytic idealism emerges as the most promising framework.

Thus, the metaphysical framework offering the most philosophically rigorous account of reality is analytic idealism.
