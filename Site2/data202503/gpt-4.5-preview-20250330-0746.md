Assessing the philosophical rigor and explanatory capacity of major metaphysical frameworks demands a careful analysis of their coherence, explanatory power, consistency with scientific evidence, and ability to address deep conceptual puzzles. Here we systematically analyze the main paradigms—analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and others—against challenges arising from consciousness research and modern physics to evaluate the most philosophically rigorous framework.

### 1. Physicalism (Materialism)
**Overview**: Physicalism holds that all reality is fundamentally physical and consciousness emerges solely from physical interactions. Mainstream science has largely operated within this framework due to its methodological clarity and historical success in explaining macroscopic phenomena.

#### Strengths:
- Highly compatible with empirical sciences and neuroscientific findings.
- Clear, reductionist explanatory schema aligns comfortably with classical physics and neuroscience paradigms.

#### Limitations:
- **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Physicalist explanations struggle profoundly with subjective experience. Objective brain activity fails to logically explain subjectivity ("what-it-is-likeness"). It faces explanatory gaps.
- **Quantum measurement/Collapse problem**: Quantum mechanics challenges the primacy of matter in fundamental ontology. The observer dependence central to quantum measurement suggests difficulty for purely physicalist explanations of quantum states.
- **Quantum non-locality, entanglement, and information issues**: These phenomena threaten simplistic matter-based causation accounts. Physicalism often requires auxiliary metaphysical assumptions (like many-world interpretations or decoherence mechanisms) without consensus resolution.
- **Cosmological puzzles (dark energy, dark matter, amplituhedron)**: Physicalism offers no explicit conceptual handle on the fundamental nature of space, time, and emergence of matter-energy itself, instead passively deferring to future physics.

### 2. Panpsychism
**Overview**: Panpsychism views fundamental particles or entities as inherently conscious or possessing primitive subjective traits, overcoming emergentism by creating continuity between matter and mind.

#### Strengths:
- Directly addresses the Hard Problem by making subjective experience fundamental, avoiding emergence problems.
- Potentially complements quantum interpretations emphasizing consciousness or proto-experience as innate in fundamental particles, possibly illuminating quantum measurement paradoxes.

#### Limitations:
- **Combination Problem**: How exactly micro-experiences combine to form coherent macro-experiences remains unresolved, challenging coherence.
- Ambiguous empirical predictions, difficulty producing testable consequences or clear experimental signatures.
- Limited explanatory leverage on dark-matter or cosmological puzzles as panpsychism by nature does not directly address structure formation or origins of spacetime, lacking a direct doctrinal interface with advanced mathematical frameworks (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes).

### 3. Neutral Monism
**Overview**: Neutral monism posits a single, neutral underlying substance (neither purely physical nor purely mental), from which mind and matter independently arise as derivative aspects or structures.

#### Strengths:
- Conceptually elegant and symmetrical; addresses hard problem by situating consciousness and matter as co-fundamental expressions of an underlying neutral substrate.
- Potential explanatory compatibility with quantum dualities and fundamental symmetries common in contemporary physics, possibly aligning naturally with dual-aspect informational frameworks emerging in quantum gravity.

#### Limitations:
- Precisely characterizing the precise nature of the "neutral" basis remains vague and challengingly abstract.
- Few precise, testable experimental consequences currently identified, contributing to unclear empirical status.
- Less direct explanatory advantage regarding contemporary cosmological issues, quantum measurement process, or information paradoxes than idealist interpretations, because it commits to a possibly inaccessible neutral ontology.

### 4. Analytic Idealism
**Overview**: Analytic idealism claims reality is fundamentally mental or experiential consciousness, with material phenomena as excitation-patterns of consciousness. Within this framework, brain activity correlates explicitly with conscious phenomenal patterns rather than generates them.

#### Strengths:
- Directly dissolves the hard problem by fundamentalizing subjectivity and reducing matter to representation within universal consciousness-fields, not vice versa.
- Potentially aligned with quantum measurement problems and quantum non-locality, as it postulates a background universal consciousness intrinsic to fundamental reality, compatible with certain quantum-idealism interpretations.
- The black hole information paradox becomes potentially explicable through consciousness/information-based ontology rather than inscrutable physics-dependent information-transport models.
- Cosmological issues (dark energy, dark matter, amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes) potentially reinterpreted as epistemically limiting manifestations within universal consciousness or ideal structures following mathematically elegant archetypal structures fully compatible with idealism's metaphysical style.

#### Limitations:
- Abstract ontology challenges empiricism in conventional scientific research; rigorous empirical predictions remain problematic without bridging hypotheses clearly linking consciousness to sensible measurement outcomes.
- Can face accusations of unfalsifiability or idealistic solipsism—though such charges are conceptual and methodological, not necessarily decisive.

### 5. Other Perspectives (Dualism, Informational Structural Realism, Process Philosophy)
- **Cartesian/Substance Dualism**: Runs into notorious interaction problems, characterized by special pleading ontological bifurcations incompatible with modern empirical science.
- **Informational Structural Realism / Digital Physics**: Information as fundamental is intriguing and compatible with quantum computational approaches and holographic ideas (black hole information paradox resolution, amplituhedron). However, pure informational ontology struggles to explain consciousness nature and qualitative subjectivity, facing explanatory gaps akin to physicalism.
- **Process Philosophy / Whiteheadian Metaphysics**: Highly integrative, viewing events and processes as fundamental. Often aligns surprisingly well with quantum cosmology and relational interpretations of physics (e.g., relational quantum mechanics, loop quantum gravity). Remains, however, somewhat abstract, vague in empirical testing, and possibly reducible (in certain forms) to panpsychist or neutral monist variants.

## Comparative Assessment and Conclusion:
To rigorously accommodate contemporary puzzles and phenomena—the hard problem of consciousness, quantum measurement, nonlocality, the black hole information paradox, emerging geometric models (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes), and cosmological mysteries (dark matter/energy)—a philosophically rigorous and explanatory ontology ideally would:

- Fundamentally incorporate subjective experience rather than attempting problematic "brute emergentism" or dualistic splits.
- Offer a coherent ontological foundation adequately flexible to accommodate quantum phenomena and cosmological complexity.
- Align conceptually with developing physics frameworks of reality-defining structures (quantum gravity, amplituhedron, holography, quantum information).

Considering these conditions, current evidence strongly favors metaphysical positions that reject naive emergence. While panpsychism and neutral monism point in the right direction, both currently face conceptual hurdles (combination problem, ambiguous "neutral" ontology).

**Analytic idealism**, specifically one refined enough to encompass the developing mathematical structures (such as states described by amplituhedron-like geometries), informational interpretations in quantum mechanics, and universal consciousness as a foundational ground of reality, currently provides arguably the most philosophically coherent, comprehensive explanatory schema. Idealism dissolves the hard problem directly, smoothly integrates quantum nonlocality and measurement puzzles via fundamental universal consciousness-fields, supplies a conceptual framework harmonious with holographic approaches to black-hole physics and quantum gravity, and avoids problematic emergence claims entirely—potentially making room conceptually for dark energy/matter as experiential structures or boundary conditions within universal perceiving fields.

Therefore, from a purely philosophical and theoretically rigorous viewpoint—irrespective of mainstream acceptance (and pending empirical accessibility)—**analytic idealism currently emerges as the metaphysical framework providing the richest explanatory coherence in addressing modern consciousness research puzzles and recent theoretical physics challenges.**
