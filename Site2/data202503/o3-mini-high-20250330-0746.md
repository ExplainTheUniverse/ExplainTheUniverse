The debate over what “really” underlies reality has led to several inventive—but as yet incomplete—metaphysical frameworks. No single view has won a decisive, all-encompassing victory. Nonetheless, when one looks for a framework that is both philosophically rigorous in its generality and open enough to accommodate perplexing empirical and theoretical puzzles in both consciousness science and physics (e.g., the hard problem of consciousness; quantum non‑locality; the measurement problem; dark matter/energy; the black hole information paradox; even novel geometric structures like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes), a variant of neutral monism (or, more broadly, a dual‑aspect or structural realist approach) comes out as especially promising. Here’s a guided tour of the major contenders and how they fare:

1. Physicalism

 • What it asserts: All that exists is physical. The mind, consciousness, and any “experience” are emergent features of physical processes.

 • Strengths: Physicalism is closely tied to the success of modern science. It meshes naturally with the standard models of particle physics, general relativity, and even emerging mathematical structures (like the amplituhedron) that hint at a deeper, pre‑geometric layer beneath spacetime. Its methods have been effective in explaining many features of dark matter and dark energy via hypothesized particles or modifications of gravity.

 • Challenges: The “hard problem” of consciousness—explaining why and how subjective experience arises—remains a deep difficulty. Moreover, some puzzles in quantum mechanics (like non‑local correlations and the measurement problem) push against a straightforward reduction of all phenomena to conventional physical interactions. Thus, while physicalism is empirically successful in many domains, it has conceptual gaps regarding the intrinsic nature of experience.

2. Analytic Idealism

 • What it asserts: The fundamental substance of reality is mental; physical objects and laws are emergent aspects or codifications of a primordial consciousness or “mind‐field.”

 • Strengths: By making consciousness fundamental, analytic idealism directly addresses the hard problem. Proponents suggest that puzzling quantum phenomena—such as non‑locality and measurement issues—might be reinterpreted in terms of an underlying mental or experiential interconnectedness. In this view, the inscrutable nature of dark energy or the informational puzzles of black holes might be seen as features of the way mind or experience “organizes” what appears physical.

 • Challenges: Although it elegantly side‑steps the mystery of qualia, analytic idealism is less naturally connected to the highly quantitative successes of conventional physics. Translating novel mathematical ideas (like the amplituhedron’s role in scattering amplitudes) into a language of experience remains speculative. The framework is philosophically ambitious but still lacks the detailed formal integration with empirical physics that physicalism boasts.

3. Panpsychism

 • What it asserts: All matter (even at the level of elementary particles) possesses some form of proto‑conscious or experiential quality.

 • Strengths: By postulating that even the “building blocks” of the physical world have intrinsic experiential aspects, panpsychism offers a possible solution to the hard problem without overturning the success of established physics. It also hints at a kind of ubiquitous connectivity that might be congenial to interpreting quantum non‑locality and the observer’s role in measurement.

 • Challenges: The “combination problem” (explaining how micro‑experiences might add up to the rich, unified consciousness of higher organisms) remains a major obstacle. Moreover, its integration with the elegant geometrical and algebraic structures that modern physics is uncovering—the amplituhedron, for example—is still in its infancy. Panpsychism may offer the right ontology for experience, but it needs to be embedded within a rigorous mathematical description that reconciles both the micro‑and macro‑physical puzzles.

4. Neutral Monism (and Dual‑Aspect/Structural Realism)

 • What it asserts: There is a single, underlying “stuff” that is neither inherently mental nor physical; what we call mental and physical aspects are two different ways of describing the same underlying reality. In many ways, this view stands at a crossroads between idealism and physicalism.

 • Strengths: Neutral monism is attractive because it does not a priori privilege the physical over the mental—or vice versa. It offers a natural language for reformulating the hard problem of consciousness: if both mind and matter emerge from a more basic neutral substrate, then the seeming intractability of subjective experience (as well as the weird features of quantum mechanics) may be reinterpreted as complementary aspects of a deeper reality. In light of recent trends in physics—where structures like the amplituhedron suggest that space, time, and particles might be emergent from an underlying mathematical or combinatorial structure—this framework has the flexibility to potentially unify insights from both physics and consciousness studies.

 • Challenges: Although philosophically compelling, neutral monism (or dual‑aspect theories) remains under–developed in precise formal terms; there is still no consensus on how to build a rigorous mathematical model that yields both the empirical laws of physics and the qualitative features of conscious experience. It is perhaps the most “open‐ended” of the views, inviting further development rather than claiming full resolution of all puzzles.

Synthesis and Tentative Conclusion

Given the successes and shortcomings outlined above, a form of neutral monism (especially when coupled with modern insights from structural realism) appears to offer the most philosophically rigorous and conceptually flexible account of reality. Here’s why:

 – It recognizes that contemporary physics is rapidly uncovering surprising, “non‑intuitive” structures (like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes) that challenge a naïve picture of matter. A neutral, underlying substrate—interpretable in structural or mathematical terms—can potentially underwrite these findings without forcing them into the old categories of “physical” or “mental.”

 – In the realm of consciousness science, neutral monism dissolves the stark boundary between the mental and the physical. If both emerge from an even more basic layer, then the hard problem of consciousness might eventually be reframed (or even dissolved) in terms of understanding the properties of that base “stuff.”

 – It avoids the pitfalls of strict physicalism—which may be too narrow—and analytic idealism—which, though it addresses consciousness head‑on, struggles to connect with the detailed quantitative structures of empirical physics. Similarly, while panpsychism shares with idealism a readiness to reclassify experience as fundamental, it still faces the hard question of how micro‑levels integrate into the rich tapestry of human consciousness.

In short, while no framework has yet “solved” all the puzzles, a dual‑aspect or neutral monist approach has the greatest promise for unifying empirical findings with the deep existential questions surrounding consciousness and the mathematical structure of the physical world. It is philosophically rigorous in that it takes seriously both the successes of modern physics and the intractable nature of subjective experience, proposing that our distinctions between matter and mind might be artifacts of our perspective on a richer, more unified underlying reality.

Thus, if one must choose a candidate that is both conceptually innovative and open‐ended enough to accommodate ongoing scientific discoveries (despite still being a work in progress), a version of neutral monism—one that may eventually be subsumed under a broader structural realist program—appears to be the most promising and philosophically robust answer to “what is really going on” in the universe.
