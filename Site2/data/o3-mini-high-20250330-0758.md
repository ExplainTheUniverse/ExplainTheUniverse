Assessing which metaphysical framework best accounts for reality—especially given the modern puzzles of both consciousness studies and physics—is a formidable task. Each candidate framework has distinctive strengths and challenges when it comes to coherently explaining phenomena like the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non‐locality, the measurement problem, and unresolved issues in astrophysics and high‐energy physics (e.g., dark matter, dark energy, the black hole information paradox, and the novel geometric structures revealed by the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes).

Let’s briefly consider several contenders:

1. Physicalism has long been the workhorse of both science and much of analytic philosophy. Its strength lies in grounding everything in the physical world—a domain that has proven extraordinarily successful in terms of empirical predictions and technological advances. However, many find that physicalism faces deep conceptual obstacles. Notably, it struggles with the “hard problem” of consciousness by having difficulty explaining how subjective experience (qualia) arises from purely physical processes. Moreover, some of the more counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics (such as non-locality and the measurement problem) and unresolved cosmological puzzles suggest that our standard notion of “physical” might be less complete than we usually assume.

2. Panpsychism is gaining renewed interest because it dissolves the epistemic gap between mind and matter by positing that even basic physical entities possess some degree of experience or proto-consciousness. This view can, in principle, recast the hard problem of consciousness by making mental phenomena ubiquitous. Yet panpsychism faces significant hurdles—most famously, the combination problem (how primitive, non-unified experiences combine to form the rich, unified subjectivity humans enjoy) and the challenge of integrating its proposals seamlessly with the rigorous mathematical structures found in modern theoretical physics.

3. Analytic idealism (a modern revival of classical idealism couched in contemporary analytic language) claims that what we take to be physical reality is ultimately an expression or manifestation of a deeper, primordially mental substance. This framework can elegantly accommodate the intractable hard problem by placing consciousness at the foundation. At the same time, however, analytic idealism often appears to be at odds with the impressively predictive, quantitative nature of modern physics. It must work hard to explain why the mathematical structures that underlie the amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes should naturally arise from an ontology that privileges mind over matter.

4. Neutral monism takes a somewhat intermediate route. Rather than insisting that the fundamental substance of reality is either strictly physical or strictly mental, it suggests that both the mental and the physical are emergent properties of a more basic, “neutral” substrate. This view is attractive because it sidesteps the need to privilege one aspect over the other. The rich abstract geometry of scattering amplitudes and other novel physical structures hints that what we perceive as “matter” might be an emergent pattern in a deep mathematical or relational network—one that may be equally compatible with experiential or proto-phenomenal aspects. In addressing puzzles like quantum non‐locality or the measurement problem, a neutral monist framework might more naturally accommodate the idea that our categorizations (as mental vs. physical) are emergent rather than primitive. Likewise, unresolved cosmic phenomena—dark matter, dark energy, and even the black hole information paradox—might signal that our conventional physicalist ontology is incomplete, pointing toward a more fundamental, neutral layer of reality.

In synthesizing these considerations, it appears that while each framework has much to offer, a refined version of neutral monism may provide the most philosophically rigorous and conceptually flexible account of reality. By positing an underlying substrate that is neither inherently mental nor physical, neutral monism can—in principle—accommodate:

• The hard problem of consciousness, by showing that subjectivity emerges alongside and interdependently with what we call matter.
• The counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics (non‐locality and measurement), since the dichotomy between the observer and the observed becomes one of emergent perspective rather than fundamental division.
• The recent mathematical insights (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes) that suggest an underlying order more abstract than classical fields or particles.
• Anomalous cosmological findings (dark matter and dark energy) and puzzles (the black hole information paradox) by inviting us to reconsider the completeness of the “physical” level of description.

Ultimately, while physicalism remains extraordinarily successful in many practical and explanatory domains, its inability to neatly bridge the gap to subjective experience—and to fully explain emerging physical anomalies—opens the door for more integrative alternatives. Panpsychism and analytic idealism provide valuable insights but encounter their own obstacles (the combination problem and reconciling rigorous physics, respectively). Neutral monism, by contrast, offers a promising middle path: a unified, monistic framework in which both mind and matter are derived from a more fundamental, neutral base. If one is willing to relax the traditional priority assigned to the “physical” and to entertain that our most compelling physical theories might hint at a deeper, neutral order, then neutral monism stands out as the most philosophically rigorous candidate for an ontology that unifies contemporary puzzles in both science and consciousness.

It should be noted, however, that none of these frameworks is without challenges, and further philosophical and scientific work is needed to articulate and test the predictions that such a neutral foundational view might entail. Nonetheless, as an account that is meant to rise above conventional dichotomies and is capable of integrating both empirical findings and theoretically puzzling phenomena, a nuanced version of neutral monism currently offers one of the most promising bridges between the mental and the physical realms.
