To assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, we need a criterion for "rigor." Let’s define it as a combination of explanatory power (how well it accounts for empirical findings and theoretical puzzles), internal coherence (freedom from self-contradiction), parsimony (minimizing untestable assumptions), and compatibility with current science (not contradicting well-established data). The frameworks under consideration—analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and others—each grapple with consciousness, physics, and their interplay differently. I’ll evaluate them against the listed phenomena: the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

### Physicalism
Physicalism posits that reality is fundamentally physical, with consciousness and all phenomena reducible to physical processes. It’s the mainstream view in science and philosophy, aligning seamlessly with empirical findings in physics—like quantum mechanics and cosmology—since it takes them as foundational.

- **Strengths**: Physicalism handles quantum non-locality (e.g., entanglement) via mathematical formalism (wavefunction evolution), the measurement problem via interpretations like Many Worlds or decoherence (though these remain debated), and dark matter/energy as placeholders for physical entities yet to be fully described. The black hole information paradox is addressed through proposals like holography or quantum gravity, while the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes fit as geometric tools refining physical theories.
- **Weaknesses**: The hard problem of consciousness—why and how subjective experience arises from physical processes—remains a gaping hole. Physicalism either denies qualia’s significance (eliminativism) or posits emergence, but lacks a mechanism bridging neural activity to "what it’s like." This explanatory gap undermines its claim to completeness. Additionally, its reliance on future discoveries (e.g., for dark matter) risks ad hoc adjustments, straining parsimony.

### Panpsychism
Panpsychism suggests consciousness is a fundamental property of all matter, not emergent. Variants range from micropsychism (particles have proto-consciousness) to cosmopsychism (the universe itself is conscious).

- **Strengths**: It dissolves the hard problem by making consciousness intrinsic, avoiding the need to explain its emergence. Quantum non-locality and the measurement problem gain an intuitive angle: if consciousness is fundamental, its role in wavefunction collapse (e.g., von Neumann-Wigner interpretation) becomes less mysterious. The amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes, as abstract structures, could reflect a mind-like universe. Dark matter/energy might be reinterpreted as manifestations of cosmic consciousness, though this is speculative.
- **Weaknesses**: Panpsychism struggles with the "combination problem"—how micro-consciousnesses form unified human minds. It’s less parsimonious than physicalism, introducing consciousness as a new primitive without direct empirical tests. Its fit with physics is loose; it doesn’t predict quantum phenomena or resolve the black hole information paradox beyond hand-waving (e.g., "information is consciousness").

### Analytic Idealism
Analytic idealism, as championed by Bernardo Kastrup, argues reality is fundamentally mental, with the physical world as an appearance in a universal consciousness. It’s a modern refinement of idealism, emphasizing empirical coherence.

- **Strengths**: It elegantly sidesteps the hard problem: consciousness isn’t produced; it’s the ground of being. Physical phenomena like quantum non-locality and the measurement problem align with a mind-dependent reality—collapse occurs in perception, not independently. Dark matter/energy could be artifacts of how universal consciousness structures experience. The black hole information paradox might dissolve if information is a mental construct, not a physical absolute. The amplituhedron and polytopes, being geometric, resonate with a Platonic, mind-like ontology.
- **Weaknesses**: It risks solipsism or requiring a "dissociation" mechanism (e.g., Kastrup’s alters) to explain individual minds, which lacks empirical grounding. Its rejection of an independent physical world clashes with science’s predictive success, forcing reinterpretation of all data as mental phenomena—coherent but less intuitive than physicalism’s realism.

### Neutral Monism
Neutral monism posits that reality is neither physical nor mental but a neutral substrate manifesting as both. Thinkers like Russell and Spinoza inspire this view.

- **Strengths**: It balances the hard problem by treating consciousness and physicality as co-equal expressions, avoiding reductionism. Quantum non-locality and the measurement problem fit if the neutral substrate underlies both observer and observed. Dark matter/energy could be neutral properties not yet fully grasped. The black hole information paradox might resolve if information is a neutral relation, not strictly physical. The amplituhedron and polytopes suggest a deeper, non-physical/non-mental order, which neutral monism accommodates.
- **Weaknesses**: The "neutral" substrate is vague—undefined beyond being "not physical, not mental." This ambiguity hampers explanatory precision and testability. It also struggles to clarify how the neutral splits into subjective and objective realms, mirroring panpsychism’s combination problem.

### Other Perspectives (e.g., Dualism, Simulation Theory)
- **Dualism**: Mind and matter as separate substances (e.g., Descartes). It’s intuitive but unparsimonious, and the interaction problem (how mind affects body) conflicts with physics’ causal closure. It flounders on quantum phenomena and cosmology.
- **Simulation Theory**: Reality as a computational construct. It explains consciousness as code but inherits physicalism’s hard problem (why does code feel?) and adds untestable assumptions about a "base reality." It’s speculative, not rigorous.

---

### Evaluation and Conclusion
- **Empirical Fit**: Physicalism excels with physics (quantum mechanics, cosmology) but fails on consciousness. Panpsychism and analytic idealism prioritize consciousness but stretch to accommodate physics. Neutral monism bridges both but lacks specificity.
- **Theoretical Puzzles**: Analytic idealism creatively reframes the measurement problem and information paradox as mind-dependent. Physicalism leans on future discoveries (e.g., quantum gravity). Panpsychism and neutral monism offer less resolution here.
- **Coherence and Parsimony**: Physicalism is coherent but incomplete. Analytic idealism is internally consistent but assumes a universal mind. Panpsychism’s combination problem and neutral monism’s vagueness weaken their rigor.

**Winner: Analytic Idealism**. It offers the most philosophically rigorous account by tackling the hard problem head-on—consciousness as fundamental—while providing a unified framework for physics’ puzzles (e.g., non-locality, measurement) as manifestations of mind. Physicalism’s explanatory gap on consciousness is a fatal flaw, despite its empirical dominance. Panpsychism and neutral monism, while promising, falter on unresolved sub-problems or lack of clarity. Analytic idealism’s coherence and boldness, even if unconventional, edge it ahead, though it demands a radical rethinking of science’s foundations. No framework is perfect, but this one balances the metaphysical load most adeptly.
