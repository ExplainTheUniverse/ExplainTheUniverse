The assessment of which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality is inherently complex, as it involves balancing empirical adequacy, theoretical coherence, and the resolution of longstanding philosophical puzzles. Here’s an in-depth evaluation of several frameworks:

### 1. Analytic Idealism
**Key Tenets:**
- Reality is fundamentally mental or composed of information.
- The physical world is a derivative or manifestation of consciousness.

**Strengths:**
- Addresses the hard problem of consciousness by suggesting that consciousness is primary.
- May provide a unified framework where consciousness and physicality are different aspects of the same reality.
  
**Weaknesses:**
- Struggles with how to account for the detailed empirical findings of physics in a way that doesn’t seem ad hoc.
- Has difficulty explaining the intersubjective nature of physical reality.

### 2. Neutral Monism
**Key Tenets:**
- A single type of substance underlies both mind and matter.
- Neither mind nor matter is primary; both are different arrangements of a neutral substance.

**Strengths:**
- Offers a parsimonious ontology.
- Can address the hard problem of consciousness by suggesting that both mental and physical states arise from a common ground.

**Weaknesses:**
- The nature of the neutral substance is often left vague.
- Struggles to give a detailed account of how neutral elements give rise to both mental and physical phenomena.

### 3. Panpsychism
**Key Tenets:**
- Consciousness is a fundamental feature of all entities, not just complex organisms.
- Mental aspects are present at all levels, from particles to human minds.

**Strengths:**
- Directly addresses the hard problem by positing that consciousness is ubiquitous.
- Integrates well with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly those that rely on observer-dependent phenomena.

**Weaknesses:**
- Faces the "combination problem": how micro-conscious entities combine to form a unified conscious experience.
- Struggles with explaining why only certain complex systems (like brains) exhibit sophisticated consciousness.

### 4. Physicalism
**Key Tenets:**
- Everything that exists is physical or supervenes on the physical.
- Mental states are reducible to or emergent from physical states.

**Strengths:**
- Aligns well with the empirical successes of physical sciences.
- Offers clear routes for scientific investigation into the nature of consciousness.

**Weaknesses:**
- Faces the hard problem of consciousness, as it struggles to explain qualia and subjective experience.
- Often criticized for its inability to fully account for the qualitative aspects of experience.

### Comparative Analysis:

**Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem:**
- **Analytic Idealism** and **Panpsychism** may offer interesting interpretations, especially in the context of quantum mechanics where consciousness or information could play a fundamental role.
- **Physicalism** tends to rely on interpretations like many-worlds or decoherence, which, while empirically adequate, do not resolve the conceptual puzzles satisfactorily for some philosophers.

**Dark Matter and Dark Energy:**
- All frameworks must accommodate these phenomena, but **Physicalism** has the immediate advantage due to its alignment with conventional physics.
- Other frameworks may suggest that these phenomena point towards a deeper, perhaps non-physical reality but lack detailed empirical models.

**Black Hole Information Paradox and Cosmological Polytopes:**
- These challenges push the boundaries of current physics and may suggest the need for new metaphysical insights.
- **Neutral Monism** and **Panpsychism** could offer novel perspectives, but would need to develop more rigorous formalisms.
- **Physicalism** would likely continue to rely on advancements within physics to resolve these issues.

### Conclusion:
While each framework has its strengths and weaknesses, **Panpsychism** emerges as a particularly interesting candidate for a rigorous metaphysical framework. It:
- Directly addresses the hard problem of consciousness.
- Offers potential insights into quantum mechanics through the observer-centric elements.
- Provides a non-reductive ontology that can accommodate complex phenomena without wholly rejecting the successes of physical science.

However, it is imperative to note that **Panpsychism** still faces significant challenges, especially the combination problem, and requires further development to provide a comprehensive and empirically robust account of reality.
