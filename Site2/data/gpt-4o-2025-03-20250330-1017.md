Your question demands a rigorous comparative analysis of major metaphysical frameworks in light of contemporary physics and philosophy of mind. Below is an assessment of how well different metaphysical perspectives handle key empirical and theoretical challenges.

---

### **1. Criteria for Evaluation**
To determine the most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework, we consider:
- **Explanatory Power**: How well does it account for both empirical findings and theoretical puzzles?
- **Internal Consistency**: Does it avoid internal contradictions?
- **Parsimony**: Does it minimize ontological assumptions while maximizing explanatory scope?
- **Integration with Science**: Can it accommodate findings in physics and consciousness studies?
- **Predictive Power**: Does it offer novel predictions or insights that can be tested?

### **2. Major Metaphysical Frameworks and Their Strengths/Weaknesses**

#### **(A) Physicalism (Materialism)**
**Core Idea**: Reality consists entirely of physical substances, properties, or processes.

- **Strengths**:
  - Aligns well with the scientific method.
  - Naturalistic explanations of brain function and cognitive science support it.
  - Reductionist accounts have provided powerful models in neuroscience and physics.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Struggles to explain subjective experience (qualia) within a purely physicalist ontology.
  - **Quantum Mechanics Issues**: The measurement problem and quantum non-locality suggest fundamental aspects of reality that resist purely physicalist interpretations.
  - **Dark Matter & Dark Energy**: Physicalism's reliance on a complete physical description is challenged by unknown components making up ~95% of the universe.

**Assessment**: Strong for empirical science but weak on consciousness and fundamental physics.

---

#### **(B) Panpsychism**
**Core Idea**: Consciousness is a fundamental property of all physical entities.

- **Strengths**:
  - Offers a solution to the hard problem by positing that consciousness is fundamental rather than emergent.
  - Avoids the mind-matter dualism issue of Cartesian metaphysics.
  - Can be compatible with physics if consciousness is tied to fundamental physical structures (e.g., via integrated information theory).

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Combination Problem**: How do micro-conscious entities combine into unified experiences?
  - Lacks predictive power beyond standard physics.
  - Still requires an explanation for why consciousness manifests in certain ways (e.g., in brains but not in rocks?).

**Assessment**: A promising middle ground but still faces theoretical challenges.

---

#### **(C) Neutral Monism**
**Core Idea**: Reality consists of a neutral substance that is neither strictly mental nor strictly physical but can give rise to both.

- **Strengths**:
  - Avoids dualism and materialism's shortcomings.
  - Compatible with quantum mechanics (e.g., Bohmian interpretation, which suggests an underlying implicate order).
  - Provides a framework for reconciling the subjective (consciousness) and objective (physical) aspects of reality.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - The nature of the "neutral" substance remains ambiguous.
  - Lacks specific empirical predictions.

**Assessment**: Conceptually attractive but underdeveloped in empirical grounding.

---

#### **(D) Analytic Idealism (Bernardo Kastrup, et al.)**
**Core Idea**: Consciousness is fundamental, and the physical world emerges from mental processes.

- **Strengths**:
  - Resolves the hard problem by making consciousness primary.
  - Offers an elegant interpretation of quantum mechanics, where wavefunction collapse can be seen as consciousness-driven.
  - Explains the measurement problem naturally: the "observer" isn't just physical but is intrinsically conscious.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Requires an explanation of the apparent regularities of the physical world if everything is ultimately mental.
  - Empirical evidence for idealism is indirect (though some interpret quantum experiments as supporting it).

**Assessment**: Strong explanatory power in consciousness studies and quantum mechanics but lacks direct empirical validation.

---

#### **(E) Quantum Idealism & Information-Theoretic Ontologies**
**Core Idea**: Reality is fundamentally informational and observer-dependent.

- **Strengths**:
  - Quantum physics already suggests reality is deeply tied to observation (Wheeler’s "it from bit").
  - The amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes suggest a geometric underpinning of physical processes that might hint at a deeper, non-material reality.
  - Can integrate consciousness as an intrinsic aspect of information processing.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Raises the question: what "grounds" information? If it’s fundamental, why does it take the form it does?
  - Interpretational debates persist on whether quantum mechanics truly implies observer-centric reality.

**Assessment**: Highly compatible with modern physics, though the nature of "information" remains metaphysically ambiguous.

### **3. Which Framework is Most Rigorous?**
Given the interplay of contemporary physics and consciousness research, **a hybrid of analytic idealism, neutral monism, and information-theoretic ontologies appears most promising.**

- **Analytic idealism** provides a powerful explanation for consciousness and quantum observation.
- **Neutral monism** avoids strict mind-matter dualism and aligns with holistic physics.
- **Information-theoretic ontologies** offer a mathematically structured basis for reality, fitting quantum mechanics and the emerging role of polytopes.

This fusion accommodates **the hard problem of consciousness**, **quantum non-locality**, and **the measurement problem** while remaining consistent with cutting-edge theoretical physics.
