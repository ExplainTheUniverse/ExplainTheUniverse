Metaphysical frameworks often strive to offer comprehensive accounts of reality, grappling with the complex puzzles presented by both consciousness science and contemporary physics. Let's evaluate each framework noted, focusing on their philosophical rigor, empirical compatibility, and ability to address these theoretical challenges.

### Analytic Idealism
**Overview:** Analytic idealism posits that reality is fundamentally mental or idea-based. The world and its objects exist as perceptions in a mind or collection of minds.

**Strengths:**
- **Consciousness:** Addresses the hard problem of consciousness robustly by asserting that consciousness is primary and material reality is a derivative or illusion.
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Could potentially explain quantum non-locality and the observer effect by framing reality as fundamentally perceptual, though this is speculative.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Empirical Compatibility:** Struggles to align with the robust, observer-independent empirical findings in physical sciences.
- **Complexity:** Faces challenges explaining the shared, consistent perception of the world across multiple minds.

### Neutral Monism
**Overview:** Neutral monism suggests that the fundamental substance is neither mental nor physical but a neutral entity that can be experienced as both.

**Strengths:**
- **Unification:** Provides a unified framework that can potentially integrate mind and matter.
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Offers a novel perspective on the nature of wave function collapse, suggesting it may be a transformation of neutral stuff.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Definitional Ambiguity:** The nature of the neutral stuff remains vague and hard to pin down empirically.
- **Complex Phenomena:** Struggles with explaining complex emergent properties and their relations to the neutral base.

### Panpsychism
**Overview:** Panpsychism asserts that all entities, even elementary particles, possess some form of consciousness or proto-consciousness.

**Strengths:**
- **Consciousness:** Provides a direct account of the hard problem by distributing consciousness throughout the universe.
- **Integration:** Potential to explain aspects of quantum mechanics, particularly the role of observation.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Combination Problem:** Difficulty in explaining how micro-conscious entities combine to form complex, unified conscious experiences.
- **Empirical Validation:** Hard to test empirically, depending more on philosophical argumentation than direct evidence.

### Physicalism
**Overview:** Physicalism posits that everything, including mind and consciousness, can be explained in terms of physical processes.

**Strengths:**
- **Empirical Rigor:** Aligns well with the empirical findings of physical sciences.
- **Explanatory Power:** Provides a coherent framework for understanding the material world and its phenomena.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Hard Problem:** Struggles to satisfactorily explain the qualitative aspects of consciousness.
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Faces challenges with interpreting quantum phenomena within a strictly physicalist framework.

### Other Perspectives (e.g., Cosmopsychism, Process Philosophy)
**Cosmopsychism:** Suggests that the cosmos itself is a single conscious entity, with individual minds being parts of this larger consciousness.
**Process Philosophy:** Emphasizes becoming and change as fundamental aspects of reality, rather than static substances.

**Strengths:**
- **Novelty:** Offers fresh perspectives that can integrate consciousness and physical reality in unique ways.
- **Dynamics:** Aligns well with the non-static nature of quantum fields and cosmological structures.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Empirical Grounding:** Often lacks robust empirical grounding and testable predictions.
- **Complexity:** Theoretical constructs can become highly abstract and difficult to apply practically.

### Conclusion
**Most Philosophically Rigorous Framework:**
Upon evaluating the frameworks, **Panpsychism** arguably offers a compelling and philosophically rigorous account of reality. It addresses the hard problem of consciousness by embedding mind at the fundamental level and provides novel avenues for interpreting quantum mechanics. Its primary weakness, the combination problem, is a substantial hurdle, but ongoing research and philosophical development may mitigate these issues.

**Runner-Up:**
**Neutral Monism** also stands out for its potential to unify mind and matter under a single framework, although it suffers from vagueness regarding the nature of the neutral substance.

These determinations hinge on balancing philosophical coherence, explanatory power, and compatibility with empirical findings. Each framework brings unique insights but grapples with its own set of challenges.
