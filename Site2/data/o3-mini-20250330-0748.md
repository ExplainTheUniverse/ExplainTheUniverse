Here’s one way to approach the question:

1. The Landscape of Positions

Many modern metaphysical positions try to “bridge the gap” between the subjective, qualitative world of experience and the quantitative, mathematical world of modern physics. Among these, physicalism continues to dominate mainstream thought by assuming that everything—even consciousness—can, in principle, be reduced to or fully explained by matter and its interactions. By contrast, positions such as analytic idealism, neutral monism, and panpsychism propose that either consciousness (or experiential qualities) occupies a more fundamental role than physical matter or that both aspects arise from an even deeper, “neutral” substrate.

2. Evaluating Physicalism

Physicalism is attractive in its parsimony: it leans on the tremendous success of empirical science. Yet, its account runs into problems when addressing persistent theoretical puzzles. For example:
 • The hard problem of consciousness poses the question of why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience.
 • The measurement problem and quantum non-locality challenge the idea that a straightforward material mechanism underlies all physical phenomena.
 • Modern puzzles—like the black hole information paradox or the apparently “exotic” features of dark matter and dark energy—suggest that our standard physical ontology might be incomplete.
In short, although physicalism nets many empirical successes, its conceptual framework is strained by the non-physical, qualitative aspects of consciousness and certain puzzling features of quantum and cosmological physics.

3. The Appeal and Difficulties of Panpsychism

Panpsychism posits that even the most fundamental entities have some form of proto-consciousness. This move has the advantage of potentially dissolving the hard problem by “spreading” experience across all levels of reality rather than requiring a miraculous emergence at high complexity. It dovetails naturally with certain quantum phenomena (e.g., non-locality might reflect the holistic features of a universe in which every constituent has experiential aspects). Yet panpsychism must confront the “combination problem” (how micro-level proto-experiences combine into the rich spectrum of human consciousness) and it can seem to multiply entities beyond what is on empirical footing.

4. Analytic Idealism’s Radical Take

Analytic idealism turns the usual assumption on its head: rather than matter generating mind, mind (or the realm of experience and information) is taken to be ontologically primary, with physical phenomena emerging as derivative or representational. This outlook can be seen as especially congenial with quantum theory if one accepts that quantum information plays a key role in the structure of reality (a perspective entertained in some quantum interpretations and even in proposals connecting the amplituhedron to more fundamental informational or geometric structures). On the downside, analytic idealism is a radical departure from ontologies that take the spatiotemporal and material world as fundamental. It requires reinterpreting a vast body of experimental work, and its explanatory machinery—while elegant to some—remains speculative and not yet fully connected to the operational details of physics.

5. Neutral Monism as Integrative Framework

Neutral monism proposes that both mental and physical properties are manifestations of a more basic, “neutral” substrate that is neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical. One appealing aspect of this framework is that it seeks to integrate insights from both consciousness science and fundamental physics:

 • It accommodates the hard problem by suggesting that what we call “physical” phenomena and what we call “conscious experience” are two facets of the underlying neutral reality.
 • Modern physics, with its increasing emphasis on abstract mathematical structures (consider, for example, the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes which hint at an underlying geometric or algebraic layer beneath apparent spacetime), seems congenial to the idea that what appears as matter and energy might emerge from a more abstract substrate.
 • Neutral monism can, in principle, incorporate quantum non-locality and the measurement problem by admitting that the features which we interpret as “spacetime events” are emergent from a non-spatiotemporal basis.
 • Its potentially broader ontology might even offer new ways to think about the gravitational puzzles of dark matter, dark energy, or the black hole information paradox—if these too are expressions of dynamics within the neutral substrate.

6. Synthesis and Conclusion

If “philosophical rigor” is measured not only by internal logical coherence but also by the degree to which a framework accommodates and perhaps even predicts puzzling empirical findings, then a version of neutral monism (or a synthesis that borrows insights from it) appears promising. While neither physicalism nor the other more radical proposals (like analytic idealism or panpsychism) have all the answers, neutral monism’s willingness to treat the mental and the physical as emergent aspects of a deeper reality has the following virtues:

 – It avoids the somewhat ad hoc metaphysical leaps characteristic of strictly materialistic or strictly idealistic systems.
 – It invites the possibility that the abstract mathematical structures uncovered in theoretical physics (such as the amplituhedron) are not merely tools but hints at the deeper “stuff” of reality.
 – It provides a conceptual framework in which both consciousness and seemingly anomalous physical phenomena can be granted a unified underpinning.

Thus, although debates are far from settled and each position has its respective challenges, a rigorously formulated neutral monism stands out for its capacity to bridge the explanatory gap between consciousness science and modern physics. It offers a philosophically rigorous account by insisting that our familiar categories of “mind” and “matter” are emergent, and by leaving open the possibility that further empirical discoveries (in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and neuroscience) might be more naturally interpreted once we accept that reality is built from a deeper, neutral base.

In summary, while no framework is free of issues, a well-articulated version of neutral monism currently offers one of the most appealing and integrative philosophical accounts of reality in light of the challenging puzzles from both consciousness studies and contemporary physics.
