It’s hard to deliver a “final answer” that everyone agrees with because each of the major frameworks—physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and neutral monism—has compelling features as well as vulnerabilities. That said, if we set aside mainstream consensus and judge each by its ability to integrate (1) the “hard problem” of consciousness and (2) some of the newer puzzles emerging in contemporary physics (quantum nonlocality, the measurement problem, the black hole information paradox, and the striking appearances of deep geometric structures like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes), then a case can be made that an approach very close to neutral monism may offer one of the most philosophically rigorous, all‐inclusive accounts of reality.

Below is a brief comparison of the positions and how they relate to these issues:

1. Physicalism  
 • Strengths: As the empirically grounded “default” framework, physicalism is buttressed by the success of the natural sciences. It readily accommodates dark matter, dark energy, and the sophisticated mathematics behind modern physics.  
 • Shortcomings: Despite its empirical successes, physicalism often struggles with the hard problem of consciousness. Explaining how subjective experience (“qualia”) emerges solely from physical processes remains a contentious, if not intractable, puzzle. Moreover, while many “interpretations” (e.g., Many Worlds, decoherence theory) have been proposed to deal with quantum nonlocality and the measurement problem, they generally relegate consciousness to an epiphenomenal status.

2. Panpsychism  
 • Strengths: By positing that basic entities (or perhaps every fundamental process) have some form of proto-consciousness, panpsychism directly addresses the hard problem. In principle, if even the simplest physical systems possess experiential qualities, then a “combination problem” could explain the emergence of higher-level subjectivity.  
 • Shortcomings: Although it has the allure of integrating mind into the very fabric of reality, panpsychism has yet to show a clear pathway for reconciling its ideas with the detailed mathematical and physical structures (such as the amplituhedron) that modern physics reveals. The “combination problem”—how microexperiences add up to unified, complex conscious phenomena—is also a persisting challenge.

3. Analytic Idealism  
 • Strengths: This view (best exemplified in some of Bernardo Kastrup’s work) flips the standard picture by positing that consciousness is primary and that what we call “physical reality” is a representation or intersubjective construct emerging within a universal mind. In this picture, perplexing quantum features (like nonlocal correlations or the collapse of the wavefunction) can be seen as natural consequences of an underlying conscious reality that is non-separable.  
 • Shortcomings: While promising in its handling of the hard problem, analytic idealism must work hard to reproduce the detailed empirical success of standard science. Its account of complex structures—be they dark energy phenomena or the amplituhedron—is at this stage more metaphorical than rigorously derived from its basic postulates.

4. Neutral Monism  
 • Strengths: Neutral monism holds that the most basic “stuff” of the universe is neither intrinsically mental nor physical but a more primitive “neutral” substance or quality. Both the subjective and the objective—conscious experience and the mathematically elegant laws of physics—would be emergent facets or “modes” of this underlying reality.  
  – On consciousness: By not assuming that either mind or matter has ontological priority, neutral monism sidesteps the forceful two‐category problem. It can (in principle) accommodate how simple, neutral properties “scale up” to the rich, qualitative experience we associate with consciousness, thus addressing the hard problem in a non-reductive manner.
  – On physics: The curious nonlocality seen in quantum experiments, the measurement problem, and even the unexpected appearances of geometric structures (like the amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes) might be interpreted as hints that the “arena” of physical reality is not built from independently existing particles or fields but arises from deeper, relational or neutral structures. This view resonates with modern ideas (such as certain forms of ontic structural realism) that the relationships or patterns might be more fundamental than the objects themselves.
 • Shortcomings: Even though it is compelling as an integrative picture, neutral monism requires us to articulate in precise, mathematically robust terms what that “neutral” ground might be. At present, it remains a promising conceptual framework with a challenge: to translate its philosophical appeal into testable, predictive models that can match the rigor of theories in contemporary physics.

Putting it all together, if one is looking for a metaphysical framework that is philosophically rigorous—one that tries to unite the puzzles of experience with the counterintuitive features emerging from modern physics—a version of neutral monism (possibly supplemented with insights from panpsychism and analytic idealism) appears especially attractive. Instead of postulating two radically different kinds of “stuff” (mind and matter), neutral monism points to a single, indefinable substrate from which both the qualitative richness of consciousness and the quantitatively precise structures of our physical theories emerge.

While no approach is without open issues (and much work remains to be done in translating these ideas into empirically robust science), neutral monism stands out by not forcing a choice between a reductive physicalist account that struggles with subjective experience and an overly “mystical” idealism that finds it hard to ground itself in our best mathematical descriptions of the world. In that sense, even though it might be less mainstream today, it arguably offers one of the most philosophically rigorous accounts of reality when it comes to unifying the puzzles of consciousness science and contemporary physics.
