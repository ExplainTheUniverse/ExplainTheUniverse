One promising answer – though admittedly provisional and open to revision as science advances – is a version of neutral monism. In this view, neither “mind” nor “matter” is fundamental in and of itself; instead, both emerge as different aspects or modes of a deeper, neutral substrate. This substrate isn’t “mental” in the everyday sense nor “physical” in the classical sense—it’s something more abstract, perhaps best described in terms of fundamental information, structure, or even proto-relations that underlie both subjective experience and the observed behavior of what we call matter.

Here’s why neutral monism can be compelling, along with its potential to accommodate thorny issues in both consciousness science and modern physics:

1. Philosophical Rigor and Unification

 a. Avoiding Dualism’s Pitfalls: Traditional dualisms (e.g., mind versus matter) have long encountered explanatory difficulties—especially when it comes to the so-called “hard problem” of consciousness. Neutral monism sidesteps the problem of how two radically different substances interact by proposing that both the mental and the physical are emergent properties of one underlying “stuff.”

 b. Bridging the Explanatory Gap: Physicalism often explains the workings of the brain in terms of neurons, circuits, and chemical gradients but seems to leave untouched the nature of first‐person experience. By contrast, if both the experiential and the material domains are simply two sides of the same coin, then even the rich subjectivity we experience finds its place in a unified theory. Likewise, strong forms of analytic idealism—which hold that only consciousness is truly fundamental—can struggle with the robust, observer‐independent regularities revealed by physics. Neutral monism offers a middle ground, one that naturally incorporates both the mental and the physical as emergent from a singular underlying reality.

2. Empirical and Theoretical Accommodation in Physics

 a. Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem: Quantum experiments have shown that particles exhibit correlations that defy classical, local explanations, and the measurement problem remains unsettled—why does observation appear to “collapse” the wavefunction? In a neutral monist framework, the conventional separation between the observer (with its apparent mental character) and the observed (physical) dissolves. The non-local, interconnected character of the quantum domain suggests that our familiar categories may be emergent approximations. In other words, the quantum “weirdness” might be a window into the underlying unity of the neutral substrate, where separability is only apparent.

 b. The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes: Recent developments in theoretical physics, such as the amplituhedron in quantum field theory and related structures like cosmological polytopes, point to an underlying mathematical and combinatorial order that does not easily map onto the conventional space–time picture. Instead of starting with a pre-existing space–time stage populated by particles, these approaches suggest that space–time and locality emerge from deeper geometric or informational principles. Neutral monism is congenial to this idea because if the “stuff” that gives rise to both mind and matter is essentially neutral and structured in an abstract, relational way, then these new mathematical constructs could be seen as glimpses of the more fundamental order out of which both subjective experience and classical physical phenomena arise.

 c. Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Black Hole Information Paradox: These phenomena are reminders that our current physical theories are incomplete or approximate. Dark matter and dark energy, which reveal themselves through gravitational rather than electromagnetic interactions, may be reflections of extra degrees of freedom or modes of the neutral substrate that our current theories obscure. Likewise, the black hole information paradox—the puzzle of how information is preserved even when lost behind an event horizon—might be resolved if one accepts that what we view as “information loss” is simply a misinterpretation of how information is encoded in a substrate that is neither traditionally mental nor solely material. In a neutral monist view, information (whether manifest as “experience” or a “physical state”) is a property of the underlying order, better aligning with ideas from holography and quantum gravity.

3. Implications for Consciousness Science

 a. Integrating the First-Person and Third-Person: Consciousness science is faced with the tough task of reconciling subjective experience with objective measurements. Under neutral monism, the gap between first-person and third-person descriptions is not one of ontological categories but of emergent modes of description. The very mathematical structures that are being proposed as the “scaffolding” of physical law could well underlie the processes that give rise to conscious experience, suggesting that the mind–body problem might be reframed as an issue of how the neutral substrate “differentiates” into domains describable as mental and physical.

 b. Addressing the Hard Problem without Excess Assumptions: Whereas physicalism sometimes struggles to explain why neural computations should give rise to phenomenal experience, and panpsychism faces the combination problem (how do elementary experiential aspects unite into a unified consciousness?), neutral monism allows for the possibility that the qualitative character of experience (the “what-it’s-like”) and the objective behavior of matter are simply two ways of describing the same underlying reality. This perspective encourages us to search for new principles that could bridge the apparent gap without having to postulate dualistic entities or rely solely on reductive physical explanations.

In sum, while no single framework has yet provided all the answers, a robust version of neutral monism appears especially promising. It not only reconciles the ontological puzzles of consciousness (by denying a sharp divide between the mental and the physical) but also meshes well with emerging ideas in modern physics. Quantum non-locality, mathematical structures like the amplituhedron, and mysteries surrounding dark matter, dark energy, and black holes all hint at a reality more intricate than our everyday classifications. By positing a deeper, neutral foundation, this view has the potential to offer an integrative account—one that is philosophically rigorous and increasingly consonant with the most avant‐garde theoretical insights in physics.

Of course, this choice does not come without challenges. Much work remains to show how exactly the neutral substrate gives rise to the rich, differentiated phenomena we observe. Nonetheless, as a guiding framework it has the attraction of unification: it dissolves traditional dualisms and encourages a search for the deeper principles underpinning both mind and matter.
