Okay, this is a fascinating and deeply complex challenge. Assessing the philosophical rigor of metaphysical frameworks requires evaluating their internal consistency, explanatory power (especially regarding challenging phenomena), parsimony, and potential for unification. It's crucial to remember that "rigor" here doesn't mean "empirically proven" but rather logical coherence, conceptual clarity, and explanatory scope concerning the *hardest* problems. No framework currently offers a complete, universally accepted, knock-down argument.

Let's break down the major contenders and evaluate them against the criteria, particularly the puzzles mentioned:

**1. Physicalism (or Materialism)**

*   **Core Idea:** Everything that exists is physical, or supervenes on the physical. The properties identified by the completed physics are the fundamental properties of reality.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Methodological Alignment:** Closely aligned with the successful methods of empirical science. Physics, chemistry, and biology have achieved immense success assuming a physical basis.
    *   **Parsimony (Arguable):** Posits only one fundamental type of substance/property (physical), although the nature of "physical" itself is complex (Hempel's Dilemma: is it current physics, or future physics? If future, the content is unknown).
    *   **Causal Closure:** The principle that physical effects have sufficient physical causes seems well-supported empirically (though challenged by QM measurement).
*   **Weaknesses & Handling Puzzles:**
    *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** This is Physicalism's Achilles' heel. It remains profoundly difficult to explain how subjective experience (qualia) arises from or is identical to complex arrangements of non-conscious physical stuff (neurons firing, etc.). Emergentist accounts lack detail on *how* consciousness emerges, and reductive accounts often seem to explain away the phenomenon rather than explain it. Rigor is low here.
    *   **Quantum Mechanics (Non-locality, Measurement Problem):** Standard QM interpretations pose challenges. Non-locality suggests connections faster than light or a deeper interconnectedness not easily captured by classical physical intuitions. The Measurement Problem (why wave functions "collapse" or branch upon measurement) lacks a universally accepted physicalist explanation. Interpretations like Many-Worlds (MWI) preserve physicalist ontology but posit vast unobservable realities. Bohmian mechanics posits hidden variables and non-local potentials. QBism leans subjective. None are fully satisfying or rigorous in explaining *why* the quantum world behaves this way from purely physical first principles *without* adding significant interpretive structure or ontological cost.
    *   **Dark Matter/Energy:** Physicalism accommodates these by positing *new kinds* of physical entities/fields within the existing framework. This is consistent, but highlights that "physical" is an evolving category. Rigor depends on whether these entities can be coherently integrated.
    *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Challenges the combination of quantum mechanics (unitarity/information conservation) and general relativity (information loss in black holes) within a purely physicalist, local framework. Solutions often involve radical revisions to spacetime concepts (e.g., holography), pushing the boundaries of standard physicalism.
    *   **Amplituhedron/Cosmological Polytopes:** These mathematical structures suggest that spacetime and locality might not be fundamental, but rather emerge from deeper, possibly combinatorial or geometric principles. This could potentially be integrated into a sophisticated physicalism (structural realism), but it challenges naive substance-based physicalism. It hints that the *structure* might be more fundamental than the "stuff".

*   **Overall Rigor:** High in alignment with scientific *practice*, but low in addressing the Hard Problem and foundational issues in QM without significant conceptual strain or promissory notes. Its definition of "physical" can be vague or overly reliant on future discoveries.

**2. Analytic Idealism (e.g., Kastrup)**

*   **Core Idea:** Reality is fundamentally mental (consciousness). The physical world is the *appearance* or representation of underlying mental processes â€“ a sort of "dashboard" of a universal mind. Individual minds are dissociated alters of this universal consciousness.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Dissolves the Hard Problem by making consciousness fundamental. Subjective experience isn't generated *from* matter; it *is* the fundamental reality. High rigor here.
    *   **Parsimony:** Posits only one fundamental substance: Mind/Consciousness.
    *   **Quantum Mechanics:** Can potentially interpret QM phenomena naturally. The observer effect might relate to consciousness interacting with its own contents. Non-locality could be seen as correlations within the unified field of consciousness, unconstrained by spatial separation (which is part of the representation, not the underlying reality). The measurement problem could be reframed as consciousness settling on a definite experience.
    *   **Amplituhedron/Polytopes:** These mathematical structures could be interpreted as fundamental patterns or laws governing the behaviour/manifestation of the universal consciousness, potentially more fundamental than the spatio-temporal "dashboard".
*   **Weaknesses & Handling Puzzles:**
    *   **Explaining Regularity/Shared Reality:** Why is the "physical world" (the dashboard) so regular, predictable by mathematical laws, and seemingly independent and shared? Idealism needs a robust account of the internal constraints or laws governing the universal mind that produce this consistent appearance. Rigor depends on developing this.
    *   **Compatibility with Specific Science:** While potentially explaining *foundational* QM issues, detailed alignment with specific physical laws, constants, particle physics, and cosmological evolution needs much more development. How does universal mind necessitate *these* specific laws?
    *   **Dark Matter/Energy:** Could be interpreted as aspects of the universal mental processes whose appearances (dashboard indicators) are inferred gravitationally but don't interact electromagnetically. Doesn't necessarily make them less mysterious, just reframes the mystery.
    *   **Black Hole Information Paradox:** If spacetime is phenomenal (part of the dashboard), perhaps information isn't truly lost in the underlying mental reality, only becoming inaccessible/scrambled on the dashboard representation. Needs fleshing out.
    *   **The Problem of Other Minds (Alters):** Explaining how individual dissociated complexes (individual minds) arise and function within the universal mind requires a detailed theory of mental dissociation and interaction.

*   **Overall Rigor:** High conceptual rigor in addressing the Hard Problem and potentially QM foundations. Offers strong ontological parsimony. However, its rigor is currently lower in providing detailed, non-adhoc explanations for the specific, regular, and seemingly autonomous structure of the physical world described by science. It's a coherent framework but needs further development to bridge the gap with detailed scientific findings.

**3. Neutral Monism**

*   **Core Idea:** The fundamental reality is neither inherently mental nor physical but some neutral "stuff" or set of properties/events that can be perceived or configured as either mental or physical depending on the context or arrangement.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Ontological Parsimony:** Posits one fundamental type of stuff, avoiding dualism.
    *   **Mind-Body Problem:** Offers a potential resolution by treating mind and matter as different aspects or arrangements of the same underlying reality.
    *   **Potential QM Link:** The abstract, relational nature of QM might resonate with a neutral base reality where properties are context-dependent.
*   **Weaknesses & Handling Puzzles:**
    *   **Nature of the Neutral:** Defining the intrinsic nature of the "neutral stuff" is notoriously difficult. Critics argue it's either vacuous or collapses into a form of physicalism or idealism/panpsychism. Rigor suffers from this vagueness.
    *   **Manifestation Problem:** How does this neutral stuff *give rise* to the distinct realms of the physical (quantitative, public) and the mental (qualitative, private)? A rigorous account of this manifestation is often lacking.
    *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** It doesn't automatically solve the Hard Problem unless the neutral stuff intrinsically possesses proto-phenomenal properties (making it lean towards panpsychism) or phenomenal properties under certain configurations (requiring a robust theory of how configuration generates qualia).
    *   **Physics Puzzles:** It offers a general schema but little specific leverage on dark matter, BH paradox, amplituhedron etc., unless combined with other ideas (e.g., structural realism where the neutral stuff *instantiates* the structures). Non-locality might be seen as a feature of the interconnectedness of the neutral base.

*   **Overall Rigor:** Conceptually elegant in its aim, but often suffers from a lack of concrete detail about the neutral elements and the principles of manifestation. Its rigor is hampered by this explanatory gap, making it hard to evaluate its purchase on specific scientific puzzles beyond general compatibility.

**4. Panpsychism (especially Russellian Monism)**

*   **Core Idea:** Consciousness (or proto-consciousness/phenomenal properties) is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. Physical properties described by physics characterize the extrinsic relations/dispositions/structure of matter, while phenomenal properties constitute its intrinsic nature. Macro-consciousness arises from the combination of micro-level consciousness/proto-consciousness.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Addresses the Hard Problem by grounding consciousness in the fundamental constituents of reality. It doesn't emerge inexplicably from non-conscious stuff.
    *   **Integration with Physicalism:** Russellian Monism attempts to integrate with physicalism by identifying phenomenal properties with the unknown *intrinsic* nature of physical entities (what fields *are*, intrinsically, beyond their relational structure). It respects the structure given by physics.
    *   **Potential QM Links:** Intrinsic phenomenal properties might relate to quantum indeterminacy or state vectors in non-standard ways, though this is speculative.
*   **Weaknesses & Handling Puzzles:**
    *   **The Combination Problem:** This is the major hurdle. How do simple micro-level phenomenal properties combine to create complex, unified macro-experiences like ours? No widely accepted solution exists, significantly impacting its rigor.
    *   **Plausibility/Parsimony:** Positing consciousness everywhere strikes many as unparsimonious and counter-intuitive (though mainstream acceptance is explicitly disregarded here). Defining "proto-consciousness" is tricky.
    *   **Explanatory Power for Physics:** Beyond providing an intrinsic nature for matter, it's unclear how panpsychism specifically helps explain non-locality, measurement, dark matter/energy, BH paradox, or amplituhedron. Does attributing proto-consciousness to dark matter particles help? Does it explain non-local correlations better than other views? Often, it doesn't add specific explanatory power to these *physical* puzzles.

*   **Overall Rigor:** Offers a rigorous approach to integrating consciousness into the physical world by addressing the intrinsic nature question. However, its overall rigor is severely hampered by the unsolved Combination Problem. Until that is addressed convincingly, it remains a promising but incomplete framework.

**5. Other Perspectives (Brief Mention)**

*   **Dualism:** Faces the severe Interaction Problem and tensions with causal closure. Generally considered less parsimonious and rigorous than monistic views today.
*   **Ontic Structural Realism:** Focuses on the reality of relational structures described by physics, potentially leaving the intrinsic nature of nodes unspecified (or denying nodes altogether). Rigorous in its alignment with mathematical physics (Amplituhedron fits well). Can potentially combine with Russellian Monism (structure needs instantiation) or Idealism (structures within mind). By itself, it doesn't solve the Hard Problem.
*   **Information-Theoretic/Digital Views:** Reality is fundamentally information/computation. Rigorous in its potential mathematical formulation and links to physics (BH entropy, holography). Faces the grounding problem (what *is* information?) and doesn't inherently solve the Hard Problem unless combined with panpsychism (e.g., IIT) or idealism.

**Comparative Assessment of Rigor:**

*   **Regarding the Hard Problem:** Analytic Idealism provides the most direct dissolution. Panpsychism offers a plausible integration but faces the Combination Problem. Neutral Monism's potential depends on its specification. Physicalism struggles significantly.
*   **Regarding QM Foundations:** Idealism offers intriguing interpretations (observer/mind involvement). Physicalism requires complex interpretations (MWI, Bohm, etc.). Neutral Monism and Panpsychism offer less specific leverage unless combined with structural views or specific hypotheses about intrinsic natures. Structural Realism aligns well with the mathematical formalism.
*   **Regarding Cosmology/Advanced Physics:** Physicalism drives the search for new physical explanations. Idealism must explain why the mental ground manifests these specific complex structures. Neutral Monism/Panpsychism lack specific advantages here. Structural Realism emphasizes the mathematical patterns (Amplituhedron) revealed. The BH paradox challenges local physicalism most directly; information-based views or idealism (where spacetime is emergent) might offer more flexibility.
*   **Internal Coherence & Parsimony:** Idealism and Neutral Monism claim substance monism. Physicalism struggles to incorporate consciousness parsimoniously. Panpsychism's parsimony is debatable, and its coherence hinges on the Combination Problem.

**Conclusion:**

No single framework is unequivocally the *most* rigorous across all domains. However, if we prioritize **philosophical rigor in addressing the deepest conceptual puzzles**, namely the Hard Problem of Consciousness and the foundational weirdness of Quantum Mechanics, while also demanding ontological parsimony:

1.  **Analytic Idealism** currently appears to offer a highly rigorous *conceptual* framework. It dissolves the Hard Problem by centering consciousness and provides a potential interpretative lens for QM phenomena that treats observer-dependence seriously. Its main challenge for rigor lies in demonstrating it can account for the specific, complex, and regular structure of the physical world revealed by science in a non-adhoc way.

2.  **Russellian Monism (a form of Panpsychism)** is also a strong contender for rigor, attempting a direct integration of consciousness with the physical structure described by science. Its rigor is critically dependent on solving the Combination Problem.

3.  **Physicalism**, despite its alignment with scientific methodology, shows lower *philosophical* rigor when confronted with consciousness and the interpretive depth of QM and cosmology. It often relies on promissory notes or interpretations (like MWI) that carry significant ontological baggage or conceptual difficulties.

4.  **Neutral Monism** remains too underspecified in most forms to be deemed the *most* rigorous, though it holds conceptual appeal.

Therefore, based on the criteria of tackling the hardest conceptual problems head-on with ontological parsimony and internal coherence, **Analytic Idealism arguably presents the most philosophically rigorous *potential* framework**, although its proponents still have significant work to do in rigorously connecting its metaphysics to the detailed findings of contemporary physics and cosmology. Its rigor lies in its bold, parsimonious starting point (consciousness) which directly addresses puzzles that baffle other frameworks, even if the constructive task is far from complete. Panpsychism (Russellian) follows closely, pending a solution to the Combination Problem. Physicalism's rigor is strong within its own domain but falters significantly at the edges where mind and fundamental physics meet.
