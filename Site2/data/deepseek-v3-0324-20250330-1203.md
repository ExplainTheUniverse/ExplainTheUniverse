To rigorously assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically robust account of reality, we must evaluate how each handles empirical puzzles from physics and consciousness science while maintaining coherence, explanatory power, and ontological parsimony. Below is a comparative analysis of the leading contenders:

### **1. Analytic Idealism (e.g., Berkeleyan idealism refined by Kastrup, Hoffman)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Consciousness Primacy:** Avoids the "hard problem" by positing consciousness as fundamental.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Accommodates the observer-dependent collapse of the wavefunction (Wigner’s interpretation).  
- **Non-locality:** Explains entanglement as a feature of a unified conscious field.  
- **Black Hole Information Paradox:** Suggests information is preserved in a deeper phenomenal structure.  
- **Amplituhedron & Cosmological Polytopes:** Geometric structures could reflect an underlying idealist ontology (mind-dependent mathematical forms).  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** No clear advantage over physicalism in explaining these.  
- **Empirical Anchoring:** Lacks direct experimental confirmation of its core claims.  

### **2. Neutral Monism (Russell, Chalmers, Strawson)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Bridging the Gap:** Neither mental nor physical is fundamental; both emerge from a neutral substrate.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** The "intrinsic nature" of matter could explain wavefunction collapse (cf. Russellian panpsychism).  
- **Consciousness:** Avoids the hard problem by not reducing experience to physics.  
- **Black Hole Information:** Neutral substrate could preserve information in a non-physical form.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Vagueness:** The neutral substrate is poorly defined (is it proto-mental, mathematical, or something else?).  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** No clear explanatory edge.  

### **3. Panpsychism (Galileo, Whitehead, Goff, Nagel)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Consciousness:** Naturalizes qualia by attributing micro-experience to fundamental particles.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Explains collapse via proto-conscious agency (Stapp’s approach).  
- **Non-locality:** Suggests entanglement reflects a deeper experiential unity.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Combination Problem:** How do micro-experiences combine into macro-consciousness?  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** No inherent advantage in explaining these.  
- **Black Hole Information:** No clear mechanism for information preservation.  

### **4. Physicalism (Standard Materialism, Eliminativism, Emergentism)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Empirical Success:** Dominates scientific discourse, well-tested in many domains.  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** Framed as yet-undiscovered physical entities.  
- **Amplituhedron/Polytopes:** Mathematical structures fit naturally within a physicalist framework.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** Struggles to explain qualia without brute emergence.  
- **Quantum Measurement Problem:** Collapse remains unexplained (unless adopting Bohmian mechanics).  
- **Non-locality:** Requires ad-hoc mechanisms (e.g., hidden variables, superdeterminism).  

### **5. Dual-Aspect Monism (Spinoza, Bohm, Pauli-Jung)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Consciousness & Physics:** Reality has mental and physical aspects of a single substance.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Bohm’s implicate order aligns with a dual-aspect view.  
- **Non-locality:** Explains entanglement as a deeper, non-separable reality.  
- **Black Hole Information:** Could preserve information in an implicate structure.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Lack of Precision:** The nature of the underlying substance is underspecified.  
- **Dark Matter/Energy:** No direct explanatory benefit.  

### **6. Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (Tegmark)**
**Strengths:**  
- **Amplituhedron/Polytopes:** Mathematical structures are ontologically primary.  
- **Quantum Mechanics:** Wavefunction as a mathematical object.  
- **Black Hole Information:** Information preserved in abstract mathematical relations.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Consciousness:** Struggles to explain qualia (why is math experienced?).  
- **Empirical Anchoring:** Highly speculative.  

### **Assessment: Which Framework is Most Rigorous?**
1. **Best for Consciousness:** **Analytic Idealism** (avoids the hard problem entirely).  
2. **Best for Physics:** **Dual-Aspect Monism** (accommodates quantum weirdness and non-locality).  
3. **Best Compromise:** **Neutral Monism** (bridges consciousness and physics but lacks precision).  

**Final Verdict:**  
- **If consciousness is the central puzzle → Analytic Idealism** wins.  
- **If quantum/relational physics is primary → Dual-Aspect Monism** is strongest.  
- **If empirical science is the benchmark → Physicalism** remains dominant but fails on consciousness.  

**Most Philosophically Rigorous Overall:**  
**Analytic Idealism** (if one prioritizes solving the hard problem) **or Dual-Aspect Monism** (if one seeks a balanced ontology). Neutral monism is a strong contender but needs refinement. Physicalism, while empirically successful, fails on key philosophical grounds.
