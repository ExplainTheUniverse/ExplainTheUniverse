Determining which metaphysical framework is “best” is a matter of ongoing debate, and each candidate has its strengths and challenges. However, if one weighs both the pressures coming from contemporary physics (with puzzles like quantum nonlocality, the measurement problem, the perplexing geometric structures underlying scattering amplitudes, and issues like dark matter/dark energy or the black hole information paradox) and the demanding questions in consciousness science (especially the “hard problem”), a dual‐aspect or “neutral monist” approach emerges as a particularly promising candidate for a philosophically rigorous account of reality.

Below is an outline of how several frameworks measure up against these challenges:

1. Physicalism  
 • Strengths: Physicalism is the workhorse of modern science. Its commitment to the sufficiency of physical processes has driven tremendous empirical progress in physics and neuroscience, and it is well suited to accommodate mathematical structures such as the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes, which are formulated within well‐defined physical theories.  
 • Challenges: When it comes to the “hard problem” of consciousness—the subjective, qualitative aspect of experience—physicalist approaches often appear to leave an explanatory gap. The standard materialist picture does not readily explain why or how subjective experience should arise from physical processes. Moreover, while physicalism allows for positing dark matter or unconventional fields to explain empirical puzzles, it sometimes seems to “patch over” phenomena (like the measurement problem in quantum mechanics) rather than provide a unifying, fundamental account.

2. Analytic Idealism  
 • Strengths: Analytic idealism reinterprets the physical world as secondary, emerging from a fundamentally mental or experiential substrate. In doing so, it casts the hard problem of consciousness into a different light—rather than explaining the emergence of experience from non-experiential matter, the emphasis shifts to how the rich structure of the “physical” might be a manifestation of an underlying mental reality. This reordering can, in principle, provide novel insights into quantum nonlocality or the unifying role of geometric objects (such as the amplituhedron) if one conceives them as intersubjective or informational patterns.  
 • Challenges: Analytic idealism struggles with explaining the apparent objectivity and stability of physical laws as well as the precise mechanisms by which concrete physical processes are “reduced” to or derived from a mental substrate. Its stance is also less developed in terms of technical integration with the mathematical formalisms used in cutting-edge physics.

3. Panpsychism  
 • Strengths: Panpsychism posits that consciousness or proto-conscious properties are fundamental and ubiquitous. This bold claim can make the hard problem less mysterious by attributing even elementary particles with a modicum of experience. In some readings, this might mesh with quantum indeterminacy and nonlocal correlations by suggesting that the “mind-like” aspects inherent in matter contribute to the holistic features of quantum systems.  
 • Challenges: The major difficulty is the “combination problem”—namely, how do simple, perhaps rudimentary, experiences or mentality at the microscopic level combine to form the rich, unified consciousness of complex beings? Moreover, the mapping between minimal experiential properties and the rigorous structure of physical laws remains speculative and underdeveloped.

4. Neutral Monism (or Dual-Aspect Theories)  
 • Strengths: Neutral monism holds that there is one fundamental “stuff” that is not intrinsically mental or physical; rather, the mental and the physical are two complementary aspects or manifestations of that substrate. This approach has an appeal in terms of parsimony—it avoids the “two kinds of substance” of dualism without reducing consciousness to mere physical processes. By positing a neutral foundation, the framework can, in principle, reinterpret quantum nonlocality, the measurement problem, and even the puzzling geometric entities in theoretical physics as different “projections” or aspects of the same underlying reality. In doing so, it accommodates the idea that both the empirical success of physical science and the subjectivity of conscious experience are genuine features that need to be explained from a unified starting point.  
 • Challenges: Even a neutral monist framework requires a precise account of what the “neutral” substrate might be and how the two aspects are individuated. Although it has the promise of offering a unified account, much work remains to articulate concrete mechanisms that could, for example, explain why gravity behaves as it does or how precise quantum correlations emerge.

5. Other Perspectives  
 There are also proposals—ranging from mathematical or structural realism (where the fabric of reality is conceived as fundamentally mathematical, a view that resonates with features like the amplituhedron) to versions of eliminative materialism—that strive to cut through traditional debates. However, many of these approaches either sidestep the challenges posed by subjective experience or simply rephrase them rather than tackle them head-on.

Summary and Assessment

Each approach attempts to reconcile the “two realms” of experience and measurable phenomena, but among them the dual-aspect or neutral monist perspective appears particularly appealing for several reasons:
 • It is modest in its ontology, positing a single underlying kind of “stuff” that can reveal itself as either mental, physical, or both.
 • It sidesteps the brute reductionism of physicalism (which often leaves the hard problem untouched) and avoids multiplying entities as in panpsychism (with its notorious combination problems).
 • It offers the conceptual flexibility to reinterpret paradoxes in quantum mechanics (nonlocality, the measurement problem) and anomalies in cosmology (dark matter/dark energy, the black hole information paradox) as expressions of a deeper, unified order—perhaps one that is also reflected in recent geometric advances such as the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes.
 • Its very neutrality invites multidisciplinary dialogue: physicists and philosophers alike can consider whether the “neutral” features might be formalized in ways that recover both the successes of empirical science and the undeniable reality of conscious experience.

That said, none of these frameworks currently provides a complete and empirically verified account. The advantages of neutral monism lie largely in its capacity to accommodate both the “hard” subjective phenomena and the “hard” theoretical puzzles without committing to an overly fragmented ontology. As research in quantum foundations and consciousness science advances, aspects of these metaphysical debates may well be refined, integrated, or even replaced by radically new ideas.

In conclusion, while physicalism remains the mainstream and empirically robust framework, a carefully articulated version of neutral monism (or a closely allied dual-aspect theory) appears, on philosophical grounds, to offer the most promising route toward a unified account of reality—one that is open enough to incorporate both cutting-edge physics and the enduring mysteries of conscious experience.
