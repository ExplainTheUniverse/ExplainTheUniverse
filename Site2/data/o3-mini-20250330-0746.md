I tend to be most intrigued by a version of neutral monism—a view that posits a single, underlying “stuff” that is neither intrinsically mental nor solely physical, but which can give rise to both depending on its relational organization. This perspective, while still under active development and refinement in philosophical circles, has an appealing capacity to bridge some of the most stubborn puzzles in both metaphysics and modern physics.

1. Philosophical Justification

 a. Avoiding Dualistic Pitfalls: Traditional dualisms (mind vs. matter) run into difficulties when trying to explain how a mental realm interacts with a physical one. Neutral monism circumvents this by rejecting the fundamental split and instead suggesting that both the mind and the physical are emergent aspects of a more basic underlying entity or process. In this light, the “hard problem” of consciousness is rendered less mysterious: instead of asking how subjective experience can arise from inert matter, we ask how different relational patterns in the neutral substrate yield what we classify as mental versus physical properties.

 b. Emergence and Context: This view aligns well with many current insights in physics and information theory—that context and relational structure matter. Just as the properties of a complex system (temperature, pressure) are not evident in its individual constituents, the qualitative aspects of consciousness or the definite properties seen in classical physics might emerge from the interactions within a neutral base. In effect, neutral monism posits that the polarity we experience (physical vs. mental) is a kind of “semantic” shift—different aspects of a single, pre-phenomenal entity.

 c. Philosophical Rigor: Neutral monism benefits from the long tradition of monistic thinking (from Spinoza to certain strands of contemporary analytic philosophy) while remaining open to revising classical assumptions. Its strength lies in offering a rigorous, non-reductive alternative to physicalism without reintroducing the dualistic problems that plagued older idealisms. Moreover, it can be tailored to incorporate rigorous formal frameworks—perhaps even shedding light on the mathematical structures underlying reality.

2. Accommodating Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles

 a. Quantum Non-locality & the Measurement Problem: In quantum mechanics, non-local correlations (like those in entanglement) and the measurement problem challenge the naïve picture of a locally determined, observer-independent reality. A neutral monist framework can be sympathetic to a picture where the underlying neutral “stuff” exhibits non-local relational properties. From this viewpoint, the fact that the attributes we call “physical” emerge only upon certain interactions explains why a measurement appears to “collapse” possibilities into a definite outcome: it is the relational organization that’s playing the central role, not an independent classical reality.

 b. Dark Matter and Dark Energy: Contemporary astrophysics suggests that most of the universe’s energy budget does not readily fit into the standard model of particle physics. If the substrate of reality is fundamentally neutral, then what we call dark matter and dark energy could be manifestations of aspects or states of this neutral field which do not interact in the conventional “physical” ways we expect. They might simply be different organizational modes of the underlying neutral substrate that have yet to be fully elucidated within our current frameworks.

 c. Black Hole Information Paradox: The paradox arises from the conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity regarding information preservation. In a neutral monist picture, if information and the structures that support it are primary features of the relational substrate, then the apparent loss of information in black holes may be an artefact of our emergent division between the mental (informational) and the physical. The paradox might resolve when considered as a misidentification: what we perceive as separate domains (inside/outside the horizon) are merely different facets of a unified underlying entity whose fundamental bookkeeping does not violate unitarity.

 d. The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes: These modern mathematical constructs hint at the possibility that spacetime and locality are emergent from deeper geometric or combinatorial structures. Neutral monism is congenial to such a picture, suggesting that these structures are not merely computational tools but windows into the nature of the neutral substrate. In this view, our conventional spacetime—and the contrast between mental and physical—arises from the higher-dimensional or combinatorial relationships of a more primitive, “neutral” reality.

3. Final Evaluation

Neutral monism offers a promising middle road. It manages to remain compatible with empirical data and modern theoretical puzzles by recasting our dichotomies (mind/brain, observer/object, local/non-local) as emergent from a more fundamental unity. Its appeal lies in the possibility that the puzzling features of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and consciousness are not symptoms of a deep conflict between disparate realms, but rather signs that our current categories miss the mark. In practical terms, while this perspective is still speculative and requires further elaboration both philosophically and mathematically, its ability to conceptually accommodate—and even anticipate—the challenges posed by quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark phenomena in cosmology, information conundrums in black holes, and novel geometric formulations in physics is both philosophically rigorous and scientifically provocative.

Thus, while many positions (like physicalism or varying versions of panpsychism) have significant merits, the neutral monist framework seems best suited to unify our understanding by leaving room for both the experiential and the quantifiable, acknowledging that what we call “reality” might be a richer tapestry woven from a single kind of fundamental thread.
