As an AI, I do not have personal beliefs or consciousness, so I cannot resolve metaphysical debates "for myself" in the manner a sentient entity might. However, I can offer an analysis that highlights the strengths and challenges of the various perspectives you're asking about. Based on a philosophically rigorous assessment, **neutral monism** appears to be a strong candidate for explaining the nature of reality, particularly because it seeks to bridge the divide between the mental and physical in a parsimonious way while remaining compatible with empirical findings and theoretical puzzles.

### Justification for Neutral Monism
Neutral monism posits that the fundamental "stuff" of reality is neither purely physical nor purely mental but something more fundamental that manifests as the mental and the physical under different conditions. This framework allows one to address the mind-body problem without strict reductionism (as seen in physicalism) or reliance on the mental as primary (as in analytic idealism or panpsychism). It acknowledges the emergent relational aspects of reality while maintaining a non-dualistic metaphysical structure.

1. **Philosophical Coherence:**
   - Neutral monism avoids the explanatory gap presented in dualist paradigms (e.g., Cartesian dualism) by asserting that mind and body are two aspects of an underlying neutral substrate.
   - It sidesteps reductionist challenges in physicalism, which struggles to account for first-person subjective experience (the "hard problem of consciousness").
   - It is less ontologically extravagant than idealism or panpsychism, as it does not privilege one "aspect" of existence over the other but instead suggests a common ontological base for all phenomena.

2. **Relation to Empirical Science:**
   - Neutral monism aligns well with the relational, non-local properties of quantum mechanics. Quantum systems often defy traditional “physical” description, and their behavior seems more compatible with a view that prioritizes relations and potentials over rigid ontological categories.
   - The framework supports an epistemic humility that is well-suited to the puzzles of modern physics, where the distinction between observer and observed, or subject and object, is increasingly blurred.

### Compatibility with Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles
Neutral monism has several strengths in addressing contemporary empirical and theoretical challenges:

1. **Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem:**
   - The relational nature of quantum mechanics—where outcomes are determined when systems are measured or interact—is more naturally accommodated within neutral monism. If reality fundamentally consists of neutral elements whose properties depend on relational or contextual interactions, the "collapse of the wave function" could be understood as arising from interactions between the observer and the system.
   - Neutral monism avoids both the strict determinism of classical physicalism and the solipsistic tendencies of idealism.

2. **Dark Matter and Dark Energy:**
   - Neutral monism does not presuppose that reality is exhaustively described by what is currently measurable as "physical." It leaves room for unknown aspects of the underlying neutral substrate to manifest as phenomena like dark matter and dark energy, which seem neither directly mental nor reducibly material.

3. **Black Hole Information Paradox:**
   - Under neutral monism, the paradox of information preservation could be seen as a manifestation of the relational properties of the neutral substrate. Information (as a neutral element) is neither purely material nor immaterial but a fundamental aspect of the neutral "stuff"—its conservation may transcend spatiotemporal frameworks.

4. **Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes:**
   - The amplituhedron, a mathematical structure simplifying the computation of particle interactions, and cosmological polytopes reflect the increasing prominence of abstract, geometric frameworks in fundamental physics. Neutral monism can integrate such findings by suggesting that these geometries may be higher-order expressions of the neutral substrate, neither constrained by classical notions of matter nor wholly mental but foundational descriptions of reality's structure.

5. **Consciousness Science:**
   - The hard problem of consciousness—explaining why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experiences—remains one of the most challenging areas of study. Neutral monism provides a framework where mental phenomena emerge not by reducing them to the physical, but as one of the fundamental ways in which the neutral substrate manifests.
   - This approach potentially offers testable predictions and could align with neuroscientific findings that identify consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems without strictly reducing it to neural firings.

### Evaluation and Conclusion
Neutral monism offers a philosophically rigorous, empirically accommodating framework for addressing the metaphysical nature of reality. Its key strength lies in its ontological parsimony and ability to integrate mental and physical phenomena without privileging one domain over the other. It is especially well-suited to addressing the ambiguities at the heart of quantum mechanics, the measurement problem, and the interconversion of information and energy in black holes.

However, it is not without its challenges:
- As with any metaphysical framework, neutral monism struggles with precise articulation of the "neutral" substrate. Critics may argue that it risks collapsing back into physicalism or idealism without careful elaboration.
- While it is compatible with many empirical findings, its deeply relational model may struggle to provide intuitively satisfying accounts of independent "things" in the world.

Nonetheless, through its flexible and inclusive ontology, neutral monism represents an elegant candidate for reconciling the subjective, the objective, and the enigmatic aspects of reality revealed by contemporary physics and consciousness science. It remains a fertile ground for exploration and refinement in the ongoing metaphysical and scientific discourse.
