As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, evaluate how well this perspective accommodates key empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary physics, including quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter/energy, the black hole information paradox, amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.
