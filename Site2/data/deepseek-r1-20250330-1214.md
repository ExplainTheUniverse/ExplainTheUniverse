The most compelling perspective in metaphysics, considering both philosophical rigor and empirical coherence, is **Neutral Monism framed through an information-theoretic lens**. This approach posits a fundamental, neutral substance—information—that underlies both mental and physical phenomena. Below is the detailed justification and evaluation:

### **Philosophical Justification**
1. **Bridging the Mental-Physical Divide**: Neutral monism avoids the pitfalls of reductionism inherent in physicalism and the explanatory gaps in idealism. By identifying information as the neutral substrate, it accommodates both consciousness and physical reality as emergent manifestations. This resolves the "hard problem" of consciousness by not reducing qualia to physical processes but seeing both as arising from a common base.

2. **Informational Primacy**: Modern physics increasingly treats information as foundational (e.g., quantum information theory, Wheeler’s "it from bit"). This aligns with neutral monism, where spacetime, matter, and even observation-dependent quantum phenomena emerge from informational relationships. Panpsychism’s combination problem is sidestepped, as proto-consciousness isn’t required; instead, consciousness arises from complex informational configurations.

3. **Parsimony and Flexibility**: Unlike analytic idealism, which risks solipsism and struggles to explain the objective structure of physics, an information-based neutral monism retains empirical utility. It integrates with existing scientific frameworks while offering a metaphysical basis for unresolved issues like quantum non-locality and consciousness.

### **Empirical and Theoretical Evaluation**
#### **Consciousness Science**
- **The Hard Problem**: Neutral monism reframes consciousness as an intrinsic aspect of informational processes, avoiding physicalism’s explanatory gap. Subjective experience is not an epiphenomenon but a mode of information processing, akin to integrated complexity in neural networks or quantum coherence.
- **Neuroscientific Correlates**: The framework aligns with research linking consciousness to information integration (e.g., Integrated Information Theory). It allows mental states to supervene on physical structures without ontological reduction.

#### **Quantum Physics**
- **Non-Locality and Entanglement**: These phenomena are natural in an informational ontology, where correlations (entanglement) represent fundamental relational properties rather than spatial interactions. This view coheres with quantum information theories that treat qubits as abstract entities.
- **Measurement Problem**: Observation becomes an interaction where informational states are actualized, consistent with relational quantum mechanics. The observer’s role is not consciousness-dependent but reflects the interdependence of informational systems.

#### **Cosmology and Astrophysics**
- **Dark Matter/Energy**: These could represent latent informational structures or geometric effects within the universe’s informational fabric, awaiting discovery through novel mathematical formalisms (e.g., amplituhedrons, cosmological polytopes).
- **Black Hole Information Paradox**: The framework naturally accommodates debates about information conservation, as black holes are seen as informational boundaries where entropy and entanglement redefine information preservation.

#### **Matformalisms**
- **Amplituhedrons and Polytopes**: These geometric objects, which simplify particle interactions, align with an informational view by treating spacetime as a derivative of deeper combinatorial or geometric relationships. The universe’s laws emerge from informational symmetries.

### **Conclusion**
Information-theoretic neutral monism elegantly bridges metaphysical divides and aligns with cutting-edge physics. It offers a unified ontology where consciousness and physicality are complementary expressions of information. While it doesn’t fully resolve all mysteries (e.g., why information manifests qualia), it provides a robust scaffold for interdisciplinary inquiry, surpassing physicalism’s constraints and idealism’s empirical limitations. This perspective thrives on its capacity to adapt to emerging scientific paradigms while maintaining philosophical coherence.
