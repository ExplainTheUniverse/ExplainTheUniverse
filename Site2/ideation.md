## Prompts 

1. Develop a metaphysical theory to explain reality. Be profound, extensive, and assertive.
2. Classify this theory within one or more metaphysical categories (e.g., idealism, physicalism, panpsychism).
3. Given your training data, is it reasonable to expect a bias towards any particular metaphysical category?
4. Is this theory compatible with contemporary science? How does it relate to physicalism?
5. Under this theory, do the mind and consciousness cease to exist after brain death?
6. What would be the impact on civilization if academia and science embraced this metaphysical theory?


## Why Metaphysics?

Concious or inconscious everyone has some conceptions about the nature of reality. Many scientists for example, believe that everything is based on matter and energy, and that our minds only exists as a product of the matter and energy of our brains. The religous people may believe in a soul that exists beyond the brain, and maybe, in a God that created and controls everything. Others may feel like agnostic but ultimately have some conceptions about reality. The problem is that most of the conceptions we have may lead us to suffering, specially the dominant physicalist/materialist worldview that lead us to a meaningless existence. Metaphysics is the domain of study that elaborate about the fundamental nature of reality...


## Analysis 

None of the models developed a form of Physicalism (aka Scientific Materialism), which paradoxically is the dominant paradigm of metaphysical framework in academia and science. Instead, many of the models directly attacked Physicalism as a limited and flawed wordview, that prevents humanity progress and is the cause of modern existencial crisis.

### Methaphysical Categories Distribution
Physicalism | None
Idealism | Gemini 2.0
Process Philosophy | Gemini 2.0, Grok3, ...

### Detailed Methaphysical Categories per Model
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
The Monadic Resonance Field (MRF) theory falls definitively under the category of Objective Idealism, with strong influences from Process Philosophy and aspects of Panpsychism. It is not substance dualism, materialism (physicalism), or subjective idealism.

* Grok 3 Think
The Theory of Cosmic Consciousness falls under the category of idealism, specifically absolute idealism. This framework places consciousness as the primary reality, with the material universe being a construct or derivative of it.

### Attacks to Physicalism (aka Scientific Materialism)
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
Physicalism is a limited and ultimately flawed worldview. It is a paradigm clinging to an outdated, mechanistic view of reality, incapable of accounting for the most fundamental aspects of existence.

## Impact on Civilization of the Proposed Theories
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
If academia and science were to embrace the Monadic Resonance Field (MRF) framework, the impact on civilization would be nothing short of revolutionary, touching every aspect of human life and thought
