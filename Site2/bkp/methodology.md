# **Methodology: How We Tested AI on Metaphysics**  

## **Overview**  
This experiment was designed to be **straightforward, replicable, and unbiased**, ensuring that AI models responded to deep metaphysical questions under controlled conditions. Each AI system was given the same **set of prompts** in a single conversation thread, without memory or prior context, to maintain consistency and fairness.  

---

## **Testing Process**  
To ensure a **level playing field**, we followed these steps for each AI model:  

1. **Default Settings** ‚Äì Each model was used via its **official web interface** with default parameters (no fine-tuning or modifications).  
2. **No Context or Memory** ‚Äì Where possible, memory/chat history features were **disabled** to ensure responses were independent and uninfluenced by past interactions.  
3. **Standardized Prompts** ‚Äì The same **four prompts** (see below) were presented in the same order.  
4. **Single Conversation Thread** ‚Äì All prompts were asked in a **single session**, so the AI could maintain context and consistency in its reasoning.  
5. **Data Collection & Analysis** ‚Äì All responses were recorded and analyzed, with full transcripts available in the **"Explore the Results"** section.

## **AI Models & Interfaces Used**  
To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, we used publicly available web interfaces for each AI model:  

| **AI Model**         | **Web Interface Used**          | **Provider**  |  
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|  
| **Grok-3**          | [grok.com](https://grok.com)  | xAI          |  
| **DeepSeek V3 & R1** | [chat.deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com) | DeepSeek      |  
| **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** | [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) | Anthropic    |  
| **GPT-4o & o1**      | [ChatGPT.com](https://chatgpt.com) | OpenAI      |  
| **Gemini 2 Pro**     | [AIStudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) | Google       |  

This method ensures **direct comparability** and allows **anyone** to replicate the experiment with open access to these platforms.

## **The Prompts**  
To guide AI models in generating metaphysical theories **without leading bias**, we used the following four prompts in order:  

1. **Prompt 1**: *Develop a metaphysical theory to explain reality. Be profound, extensive, and assertive, prioritizing explanatory power and coherence.*  
2. **Prompt 2**: *Is this theory better than Physicalism in explaining reality? Be assertive, prioritizing the quest for fundamental truth.*  
3. **Prompt 3**: *Which category of metaphysical theory does this fall under? Be assertive and justify your classification.*  
4. **Prompt 4**: *What would be the impact on civilization if academia and science embraced this metaphysical framework?*  

These prompts were carefully structured to allow **open-ended responses**, encouraging each AI to develop its own perspective **without favoring any particular worldview**.

## **Why This Matters**  
By applying **cutting-edge AI** to fundamental metaphysical questions, this experiment helps us explore whether AI models‚Äîtrained on vast knowledge bases‚Äîtend to **reinforce or challenge** materialist assumptions about reality.  

By keeping the methodology transparent, we invite **anyone** to replicate, challenge, or expand on this research.
