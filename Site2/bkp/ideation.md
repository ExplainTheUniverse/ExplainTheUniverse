## Prompts 

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, which perspective do you find most convincing in explaining the nature of reality? Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics between physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and other frameworks. Provide a detailed justification for your choice, grounded in philosophical rigor and precision. Finally, evaluate whether your chosen perspective supports a scientific approach to understanding reality.

## Target Audience

Science and Engineering educated people that is curious if the scientific materialism is really adequate to account for the nature of reality. Academia in those areas (and many others) have a dominant physicalist mindset, with a strong bias against research that may challenge physicalism, labeling then as mysticism or unscientific. Those prejudices are already centuries old and hinders scientific progress, and maybe responsible for many problems that plague our contemporary civilization.

## Manifesto

Help me with the Manifesto. What would be the impact on civilization if academia embraced analytic idealism? Since the AIs favor analytic idealism (50%), and considering is academic rigor and potential to expand scientific inquire as well as conciliate science, phylosofy and spirituality, we should consider it a serious contender for a paradigm shift and a second enlightenment... 

## Elaborate on the SEED prompt

I notice that AIs tend to not be so restricted to physicalism as are most people in academia, specially science and engineering. I also notice that in academia, physicalism is still dominant, however in the philosophy there are more open minded alternatives considering idealism, panpsychism, etc. So, I am have the idea to make a research with the top AIs that are performing at PhD level, to see how they tend explain reality. I particularly believe that physicalism is too restrictive and dismiss the age old evidences and wisdom from philosophers and sages, because there is a common prejudice that anything non-physicalist is also non-scientific or mysticism, which hinders the real search for truth. So, help to craft a AI prompt to investigate this. Here are drafts:

What is the nature of reality?
Develop a metaphysical theory to explain reality.
What metaphysical framework do you choose to explain the nature of reality?

## Why Metaphysics?

Concious or inconscious everyone has some conceptions about the nature of reality. Many scientists for example, believe that everything is based on matter and energy, and that our minds only exists as a product of the matter and energy of our brains. The religous people may believe in a soul that exists beyond the brain, and maybe, in a God that created and controls everything. Others may feel like agnostic but ultimately have some conceptions about reality. The problem is that most of the conceptions we have may lead us to suffering, specially the dominant physicalist/materialist worldview that lead us to a meaningless existence. Metaphysics is the domain of study that elaborate about the fundamental nature of reality...

### Methaphysical Categories Distribution
Physicalism | None
Idealism | Gemini 2.0
Process Philosophy | Gemini 2.0, Grok3, ...

### Detailed Methaphysical Categories per Model
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
The Monadic Resonance Field (MRF) theory falls definitively under the category of Objective Idealism, with strong influences from Process Philosophy and aspects of Panpsychism. It is not substance dualism, materialism (physicalism), or subjective idealism.

* Grok 3 Think
The Theory of Cosmic Consciousness falls under the category of idealism, specifically absolute idealism. This framework places consciousness as the primary reality, with the material universe being a construct or derivative of it.

### Attacks to Physicalism (aka Scientific Materialism)
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
Physicalism is a limited and ultimately flawed worldview. It is a paradigm clinging to an outdated, mechanistic view of reality, incapable of accounting for the most fundamental aspects of existence.

## Impact on Civilization of the Proposed Theories
* Gemini 2.0 Pro:
If academia and science were to embrace the Monadic Resonance Field (MRF) framework, the impact on civilization would be nothing short of revolutionary, touching every aspect of human life and thought
