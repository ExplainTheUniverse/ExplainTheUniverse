To assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, we need to examine the ongoing debate in metaphysics and evaluate how well each framework accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics.

1. **Physicalism**: This is the view that everything that exists is physical. While it has been widely influential, physicalism faces significant challenges, particularly with the hard problem of consciousness, which questions why we have subjective experiences at all. Physicalism struggles to explain the nature of subjective experience and how it arises from purely physical processes.

2. **Panpsychism**: This perspective posits that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the natural world. Panpsychism attempts to address the hard problem of consciousness by suggesting that even basic entities, such as electrons, possess some form of consciousness or mental properties. However, it faces challenges in explaining how simple forms of consciousness combine to form complex human consciousness.

3. **Neutral Monism**: This framework posits that both mind and matter are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality that is neither physical nor mental. Neutral monism can offer a more nuanced view of the relationship between consciousness and the physical world, potentially accommodating aspects of both physicalism and idealism. However, it is often criticized for being too vague or for failing to provide clear, testable predictions.

4. **Analytic Idealism**: Proposed by Bernardo Kastrup, analytic idealism posits that reality is fundamentally mental and that the physical world is a representation or manifestation of this mental reality. It attempts to reconcile the insights of idealism with the rigor of analytic philosophy. Analytic idealism offers an explanation for the hard problem of consciousness by positing that consciousness is fundamental and that the physical world is a 'mentation' or 'representation' within this consciousness.

Evaluating these frameworks against empirical findings and theoretical puzzles:

- **The Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Analytic idealism directly addresses this by positing that consciousness is fundamental. Panpsychism also attempts to tackle this issue, albeit with its own set of challenges.

- **Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem**: Neutral monism and analytic idealism can potentially offer explanations for these phenomena by suggesting that the fundamental reality is not bound by the constraints of space and time as we experience them. For instance, if reality is fundamentally mental, quantum non-locality could be seen as a manifestation of a non-spatial, interconnected mental reality.

- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: These phenomena are challenging for all metaphysical frameworks as they are not directly observable. However, a framework that posits a more fundamental, unobservable reality (such as neutral monism or analytic idealism) might offer a more flexible explanatory structure for these phenomena.

- **The Black Hole Information Paradox**: This paradox questions what happens to the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole. Analytic idealism might suggest that information is not lost but is preserved in the fundamental mental reality, potentially offering a novel perspective on this issue.

- **The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes**: These are mathematical constructs that simplify the calculation of particle interactions and cosmological phenomena, respectively. A metaphysical framework that emphasizes the fundamental nature of mathematical or mental structures (like analytic idealism) might find these constructs particularly insightful or even predictive of a deeper, underlying reality.

In conclusion, while all the metaphysical frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses, **analytic idealism** offers a philosophically rigorous account of reality that accommodates a wide range of empirical findings and theoretical puzzles. Its ability to directly address the hard problem of consciousness and offer novel perspectives on quantum mechanics, dark matter, and other phenomena make it a compelling choice. However, the assessment of metaphysical frameworks is inherently complex and subject to ongoing philosophical debate. The most rigorous account will depend on how well a framework can coherently explain a broad spectrum of phenomena while maintaining internal consistency and aligning with empirical evidence.
