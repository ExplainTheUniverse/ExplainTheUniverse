Assessing the metaphysical frameworks that offer the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, regardless of mainstream acceptance, requires a comprehensive evaluation of various perspectives, including analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, and physicalism. To determine which framework is the most robust, we will examine how well each accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics.

First, let's consider the hard problem of consciousness, which questions why we have subjective experiences at all. Analytic idealism, proposed by Bernardo Kastrup, suggests that consciousness is fundamental and that the physical world is a manifestation of mental processes. This perspective offers a straightforward solution to the hard problem by positing that consciousness is not derived from physical processes but is instead the basis of reality. Neutral monism, which posits that both mind and matter are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality, also provides a potential solution by suggesting that consciousness arises from this neutral basis. Panpsychism, the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the world, similarly addresses the hard problem by positing that even basic entities possess some form of consciousness.

In contrast, physicalism, which asserts that everything can be explained by physical processes, struggles to account for the hard problem. Physicalist explanations often rely on functional or behavioral explanations of consciousness, which many argue fail to capture the essence of subjective experience.

Turning to contemporary physics, several phenomena challenge the metaphysical frameworks under consideration. Quantum non-locality, which indicates that particles can be instantaneously entangled regardless of distance, is difficult to reconcile with physicalism's emphasis on local causation. Analytic idealism and neutral monism can accommodate non-locality more elegantly by suggesting that the underlying reality is fundamentally mental or neutral, allowing for non-local connections as a natural aspect of this reality. Panpsychism can also account for non-locality by positing that consciousness enables a form of non-local interconnectedness.

The measurement problem in quantum mechanics, which questions why the act of measurement causes a quantum system to collapse from a superposition of states to a single state, is another challenge. Analytic idealism resolves this issue by suggesting that consciousness plays a key role in the measurement process, thereby collapsing the wave function. Neutral monism could also potentially resolve this by positing that the fundamental reality is such that it encompasses both the potential for superposition and the actualization upon measurement in a way that doesn't require a strict dichotomy between observer and observed. Panpsychism shares a similar potential by attributing a role to consciousness in the measurement process.

Dark matter and dark energy, which are significant components of the universe's mass-energy budget but are not directly observable, pose a challenge to physicalism. While physicalism can accommodate these phenomena within its framework by positing unknown physical entities or forces, it does so without providing a clear understanding of their nature. Analytic idealism and neutral monism can offer alternative perspectives, suggesting that these phenomena could be related to aspects of reality that are not directly accessible through physical measurement but are integral to the fundamental nature of the universe.

The black hole information paradox, which questions what happens to the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole, is another theoretical puzzle. Physicalist theories have proposed various solutions, including black hole complementarity and firewall hypotheses, but these remain contentious. Analytic idealism, by positing that information is fundamentally mental, might offer a different perspective on this paradox, potentially resolving it by suggesting that information is not lost but rather transformed in a way that's not accessible to physical observation.

The amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes, mathematical constructs that simplify the calculation of particle interactions and the structure of the universe, respectively, indicate a deep mathematical structure underlying reality. While physicalism can accommodate these findings by highlighting the mathematical nature of physical laws, analytic idealism and neutral monism can also incorporate them by suggesting that these mathematical structures reflect the inherent order of a fundamentally mental or neutral reality.

In conclusion, evaluating the metaphysical frameworks based on their ability to accommodate empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics, analytic idealism emerges as a particularly robust framework. It offers straightforward solutions to the hard problem of consciousness and provides elegant explanations for quantum non-locality and the measurement problem. While neutral monism and panpsychism also show promise, analytic idealism's comprehensive and coherent account of a wide range of phenomena makes it a compelling choice for a philosophically rigorous account of reality. Physicalism, despite its mainstream acceptance, struggles with several of these challenges, particularly the hard problem of consciousness.

Ultimately, the most philosophically rigorous account of reality will depend on further developments in both metaphysics and the sciences. However, based on current understanding and the ability to address key challenges, analytic idealism presents a strong case as a foundational metaphysical framework.
