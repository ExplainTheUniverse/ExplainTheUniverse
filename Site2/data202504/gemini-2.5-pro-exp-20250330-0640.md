Okay, let's engage in an assessment of metaphysical frameworks based on philosophical rigor, particularly concerning their ability to integrate challenging findings from consciousness science and contemporary physics. "Philosophical rigor" here will encompass internal coherence, explanatory power (especially regarding the listed puzzles), parsimony (though what counts as parsimonious can be debated), and potential for fruitful integration with scientific inquiry, irrespective of mainstream acceptance.

**Defining the Challenge:**

The core challenge is unifying our understanding of subjective experience (consciousness) with the objective, mathematical descriptions of the physical world provided by science, especially physics, which increasingly reveals counter-intuitive phenomena at fundamental levels and vast cosmological scales.

**The Contenders and Their Assessment:**

1.  **Physicalism (Materialism):**
    *   **Core Tenet:** Everything that exists is physical, or supervenes on the physical. Consciousness is an emergent property, computational process, or functional state of complex physical systems (like brains).
    *   **Strengths:** Aligns well with the methodology and successes of physical sciences. Prima facie parsimonious by positing only one fundamental type of substance/property (physical). Directly addresses physical puzzles like dark matter/energy by seeking *physical* explanations (new particles, modified gravity).
    *   **Weaknesses & Puzzle Integration:**
        *   **Hard Problem of Consciousness:** This remains the most significant stumbling block. Explaining *why* and *how* physical processing gives rise to subjective experience (qualia) from purely non-experiential components is profoundly difficult. Current physicalist accounts often explain functions *associated* with consciousness, not subjectivity itself. This lack of explanatory power is a major deficit in rigor regarding consciousness.
        *   **QM Measurement Problem:** Standard physicalism struggles. Interpretations like Copenhagen introduce an observer/measurement distinction that seems non-physicalist or ill-defined. Many-Worlds preserves physicalist ontology but at the cost of immense ontological extravagance (countless universes) and difficulties explaining probability (Born rule). Objective collapse models posit new physical processes but lack direct empirical support and can seem ad hoc.
        *   **QM Non-locality:** While compatible with physical laws (no FTL signalling), it challenges intuitive notions of local realism often associated with physicalism. It suggests a deep interconnectedness that standard substance/field ontologies might not fully capture.
        *   **BH Information Paradox:** Suggests a potential conflict between GR and QM, possibly requiring non-local effects or a breakdown of standard spacetime descriptions near singularities, challenging straightforward physicalist pictures.
        *   **Amplituhedron/Cosmological Polytopes:** These mathematical structures seem to underlie physical scattering amplitudes and cosmological correlations, potentially suggesting that spacetime locality and unitarity (cornerstones of standard physicalism) might be emergent from more fundamental combinatorial or geometric principles. Physicalism needs to explain the ontological status of these mathematical objects and why they are so effective.
    *   **Rigor Assessment:** High rigor in aligning with scientific *method*, but faces severe explanatory gaps regarding consciousness and foundational physics puzzles, potentially indicating its core ontology is incomplete or incorrect. Its parsimony is challenged if it requires complex additions (many worlds, ad hoc collapse mechanisms) to fit the data.

2.  **Panpsychism:**
    *   **Core Tenet:** Consciousness (or proto-consciousness/phenomenal properties) is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. Macro-consciousness (like human experience) arises from the combination or organisation of micro-level consciousness/proto-consciousness.
    *   **Strengths:** Directly addresses the Hard Problem by grounding consciousness in the fundamental constituents of reality, avoiding emergence from wholly non-conscious stuff. Can potentially integrate with physics by associating phenomenal properties with intrinsic aspects of fundamental particles/fields (e.g., information). Some variants resonate with information-theoretic interpretations of QM.
    *   **Weaknesses & Puzzle Integration:**
        *   **The Combination Problem:** How do simple micro-level phenomenal properties combine to form complex macro-level consciousness? This is the "hard problem" for panpsychism and lacks a widely accepted solution. It's a major challenge to its coherence and explanatory power.
        *   **Explanatory Power for Physics:** While it *accommodates* consciousness, it doesn't inherently *explain* the specific laws of physics, dark matter/energy, the BH paradox, or the efficacy of mathematical structures like the Amplituhedron any better than physicalism, unless specific (often speculative) links are forged (e.g., information-based versions).
        *   **QM Measurement/Non-locality:** Could potentially view measurement as an interaction revealing intrinsic phenomenal properties or involving a fundamental role for information, aligning with some non-standard QM interpretations. Non-locality might be seen as a feature of the interconnected phenomenal ground. However, specific, rigorous models are lacking.
        *   **Parsimony:** Adds consciousness as a fundamental property, which might seem less parsimonious than physicalism *unless* physicalism fails to explain consciousness at all, making panpsychism potentially *more* explanatorily adequate.
    *   **Rigor Assessment:** Offers a potential solution to the Hard Problem, making it more rigorous than physicalism *on that front*. However, the Combination Problem is a serious internal challenge. Its integration with specific physics puzzles is often speculative and less developed than physicalist attempts. Rigor depends heavily on solving the Combination Problem.

3.  **Neutral Monism:**
    *   **Core Tenet:** The fundamental reality is neither inherently mental nor inherently physical but some neutral "stuff" or set of properties that can manifest as either mental or physical depending on context or organisation.
    *   **Strengths:** Avoids the Hard Problem and the Interaction Problem (of dualism) by positing a single underlying reality. Potentially elegant and parsimonious if the neutral base can genuinely explain both domains. Could resonate with structural realism or information-theoretic views where the *relations* or *information* are fundamental, and their intrinsic nature is neutral.
    *   **Weaknesses & Puzzle Integration:**
        *   **Nature of the Neutral:** Often criticized for being vague. What *is* this neutral stuff? How does it give rise to the seemingly disparate properties of mentality and physicality? Explaining this manifestation is crucial and difficult (the "Manifestation Problem").
        *   **Explanatory Power for Specifics:** Like panpsychism, it doesn't automatically explain specific physical laws, constants, dark matter/energy, or the intricacies of QM or the BH paradox. How does the neutral base account for the Amplituhedron's structure or cosmological correlations? Specific models are needed.
        *   **QM/Consciousness:** Could potentially view the neutral base as informational, linking observer effects in QM to the process by which neutral information manifests mentally. Non-locality could be a feature of the underlying neutral structure.
    *   **Rigor Assessment:** Conceptually appealing for its potential unity and parsimony, but often lacks the explanatory detail and clarity needed for high rigor. Its success hinges entirely on specifying the nature of the neutral base and its manifesting principles in a non-ad hoc way that can address the hard problem and physics puzzles. Currently more of a promissory note.

4.  **Analytic Idealism (e.g., Kastrup):**
    *   **Core Tenet:** Reality is fundamentally mental or experiential. The physical world is an appearance *within* consciousness, a representation of trans-personal mental processes. There is fundamentally only one universal consciousness, and individual minds are dissociated alters of this one mind.
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   **Hard Problem:** Dissolves the Hard Problem by definition, as consciousness is all there is.
        *   **QM Measurement/Observer:** Naturally accommodates the observer effect – reality is constituted by observation/experience. The "collapse" is simply the specification of mental content. Non-locality is less problematic if separation in space is merely a feature of the *representation* within a unified consciousness, not fundamental separation.
        *   **Parsimony:** Ontologically parsimonious – posits only one fundamental category (consciousness/mind).
        *   **Potential Physics Links:** Some argue the mathematical nature of physics describes the formal structure and regularities of conscious experience/mental processes. The efficacy of mathematics (like Amplituhedron) might be seen as reflecting the logical/mathematical structure inherent to mind itself.
    *   **Weaknesses & Puzzle Integration:**
        *   **Explaining the Physical World's Regularity & Autonomy:** Why does the physical world appear so stable, structured by precise mathematical laws, seemingly independent of individual human minds? Idealism needs a robust account of this (e.g., the laws governing the universal consciousness itself). This is a major explanatory hurdle often termed the "problem of empirical constraints" or "why the dream is so consistent."
        *   **Specific Physics Puzzles:** While QM interpretations might seem natural, explaining dark matter/energy requires seeing them as specific modes or patterns within the universal mental reality, which needs detailed articulation. Explaining the BH paradox or deriving the Standard Model from purely mental principles is a formidable, largely unmet challenge. How does universal mind necessitate black holes behaving this way, or specific particle masses?
        *   **Counter-intuitiveness:** While not strictly a measure of rigor, its radical departure from common sense and standard scientific assumptions makes its detailed defence more demanding.
    *   **Rigor Assessment:** Offers remarkable ontological parsimony and a direct dissolution of the Hard Problem. It potentially provides a natural framework for understanding QM's observer-dependence and non-locality. Its primary challenge to rigor lies in demonstrating sufficient explanatory power for the *specific content, structure, and regularities* of the physical world as described by science, moving beyond accommodation to genuine explanation or derivation. If it can convincingly explain *why* the mental manifests with the specific structures described by physics (including cosmology, particle physics, etc.), its rigor would be exceptionally high.

5.  **Other Perspectives (Briefly):**
    *   **Dualism (Substance/Property):** Suffers notoriously from the Interaction Problem (how do non-physical and physical interact?), violating physical conservation laws or requiring constant intervention. Property dualism is closer to some forms of panpsychism or emergentism but struggles to explain *why* these properties emerge from the physical. Generally considered less rigorous due to the interaction problem and lack of parsimony.
    *   **Process Philosophy (Whitehead):** Views reality as dynamic processes or "actual occasions" with both physical and mental poles. Offers potential integration but can be highly complex and interpretations vary. Its connection to specific modern physics puzzles like the Amplituhedron or BH paradox is often less direct than other frameworks.

**Comparative Conclusion on Rigor:**

Based on the criteria, particularly the integration of both consciousness and the listed physics puzzles:

*   **Physicalism:** Remains the default for many due to its alignment with scientific method, but its rigor is severely undermined by its explanatory failure regarding the Hard Problem and the conceptual difficulties it faces with interpretations of fundamental physics (QM, potentially spacetime).
*   **Panpsychism & Neutral Monism:** Offer promising avenues for addressing the Hard Problem and potentially integrating information-based aspects of physics, but face significant internal conceptual challenges (Combination Problem, specifying the Neutral) and haven't yet provided detailed, rigorous explanations for many specific physics puzzles.
*   **Analytic Idealism:** Stands out for its ontological parsimony and its potential to dissolve the Hard Problem and naturally accommodate observer-dependent aspects of QM and non-locality. Its rigor *could potentially be the highest* IF it can develop sufficiently detailed and non-ad hoc explanations for the specific mathematical structures, laws, and phenomena observed in the physical sciences (cosmology, particle physics, etc.) from its sole mentalistic foundation. This remains a very significant challenge.

**Tentative Judgement:**

No framework currently offers a universally accepted, fully rigorous account satisfying all criteria for all puzzles. However, frameworks that posit consciousness or a related precursor (information, neutral base) as fundamental seem increasingly plausible candidates for unifying consciousness science and the strange findings of fundamental physics, *precisely because* these findings challenge classical physicalist intuitions about locality, substance, and observer-independence.

**Analytic Idealism currently offers perhaps the most *ontologically parsimonious* and *conceptually unified* potential framework for addressing the Hard Problem and QM weirdness simultaneously.** Its main hurdle for achieving superior *overall philosophical rigor* is demonstrating the explanatory power to account for the detailed structure and behaviour of the physical world (the content of physics and cosmology) from its mentalistic starting point.

If forced to choose the framework offering the *most potential* for future philosophical rigor in unifying these disparate and challenging domains, **Analytic Idealism** presents a compelling, albeit radical, case due to its parsimony and direct handling of consciousness and observer-dependence. However, this potential is far from realized, and significant explanatory work is required. Sophisticated versions of Panpsychism or Neutral Monism that successfully address their internal problems and integrate with physics could also become leading contenders. Physicalism, in its current form, seems increasingly strained by the evidence unless radically revised, potentially towards something resembling neutral monism or information-based ontologies.
