Okay, this is a fascinating and deeply complex question. Assessing the "philosophical rigor" of metaphysical frameworks, especially concerning cutting-edge science and intractable philosophical problems, requires careful consideration of criteria like internal consistency, explanatory power, coherence with empirical data (even if reinterpreted), and capacity to address deep puzzles. Mainstream acceptance is explicitly disregarded.

Here's an assessment of prominent frameworks based on these criteria:

**1. Physicalism (or Materialism)**

*   **Core Thesis:** Reality is fundamentally physical; everything that exists is physical or supervenes on the physical. Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon, a functional state, or identical to physical brain processes.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Coherence with Scientific Method:** Aligns naturally with the methodology and ontology implicitly assumed by most working scientists. Its success in explaining the physical world is undeniable.
    *   **Empirical Accommodation:** Easily accommodates most empirical findings in physics and neuroscience *as descriptions of the physical world*. Dark matter/energy are posited as *physical* entities/fields, fitting the framework. Black hole physics, QM phenomena, etc., are problems *within* physics, which physicalism expects science to eventually solve physically.
    *   **Parsimony (Ontological):** Often claims ontological simplicity by positing only one fundamental kind of stuff (physical).
*   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**
    *   **The Hard Problem of Consciousness:** This is the Achilles' heel. Explaining *why* physical processing should give rise to subjective experience (qualia) remains profoundly difficult (the "explanatory gap"). Reductive accounts often seem to explain away consciousness rather than explain it. Emergentist accounts struggle to specify how consciousness "emerges" non-reductively without invoking fundamentally new properties (verging on property dualism).
    *   **Quantum Mechanics:** While QM describes physical systems, certain interpretations pose challenges. The measurement problem (what constitutes a measurement? role of the observer?) can be awkward. Non-locality strains classical intuitions about physical interactions, requiring acceptance of fundamentally non-local physical realities (e.g., quantum fields, entanglement). Interpretations like Many-Worlds involve vast, unobservable ontological commitments. QBism shifts focus to observer beliefs, potentially straining standard physicalism.
    *   **Nature of the "Physical":** Physics itself keeps revealing stranger realities (fields, quantum foam, potentially information-based structures). Hempel's Dilemma suggests "physical" is either defined by current physics (likely incomplete) or future physics (content unknown), making the thesis somewhat vacuous or perpetually provisional.
    *   **Abstract Objects & Mathematics:** The status of mathematical objects (like the Amplituhedron or Cosmological Polytopes) is ambiguous. Are they physical? If not, how does physicalism account for their effectiveness and apparent reality? Physicalists often adopt nominalist or fictionalist stances, but the deep structure suggested by these mathematical forms pushes back.
*   **Rigor Assessment:** High rigor in terms of alignment with scientific practice and empirical data *description*. Lower rigor in providing a *complete* explanation, especially regarding consciousness and the foundational interpretation of physics. Its core challenge is the Hard Problem, suggesting a potential incompleteness in its fundamental ontology.

**2. Analytic Idealism (e.g., Kastrup)**

*   **Core Thesis:** Reality is fundamentally mental (consciousness). The physical world is an *appearance*, a representation, or the extrinsic aspect of mental processes (often within a universal or cosmic consciousness). Individual minds are dissociated alters of this universal consciousness.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **The Hard Problem:** Solved directly by making consciousness the fundamental reality. There is no gap to bridge from matter to mind.
    *   **Quantum Mechanics:** Can potentially interpret QM phenomena more naturally. The observer effect isn't problematic if reality is mind-like; measurement can be seen as an interaction *within* consciousness. Non-locality is less strange if space itself is a construct within consciousness, not a fundamental container.
    *   **Parsimony (Ontological):** Posits only one fundamental substance: consciousness.
*   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**
    *   **Explaining the Physical World's Regularity:** Why does the "shared dream" or appearance have such stable, mathematically precise laws? Idealism needs a robust account of *why* the world appears physical, regular, and largely independent of individual minds (Kastrup uses dissociation and evolutionary metaphors for constraints within universal consciousness). This is the "hard problem of matter" for idealism.
    *   **Integrating Specific Physics:** Needs to explain *why* the specific constants, particles, and forces described by physics manifest. Why dark matter/energy as specific appearances? Why the specific structure revealed by the Amplituhedron or black hole thermodynamics? It must ground these specifics in the dynamics of the underlying consciousness.
    *   **Empirical Grounding:** While it *accommodates* empirical findings as appearances, it doesn't *predict* them from first principles as easily as physicalism seems to. It risks becoming a "just so" story unless it can constrain the possibilities of appearance.
    *   **Solipsism/Other Minds:** While analytic idealism often posits a *universal* consciousness, explaining the distinctness and apparent privacy of individual minds (dissociation) requires careful articulation to avoid collapsing into solipsism or losing individuality entirely.
*   **Rigor Assessment:** High rigor in addressing the Hard Problem and potentially offering a more coherent interpretation of observer-dependent aspects of QM. Lower rigor (or faces significant challenges) in explaining the specific, regular, and seemingly autonomous nature of the physical world and its detailed laws. Its explanatory power regarding the *content* of physics is less developed than physicalism's.

**3. Neutral Monism**

*   **Core Thesis:** The fundamental reality is neither intrinsically mental nor intrinsically physical, but a neutral "stuff" or set of neutral properties/events. Mind and matter are different aspects or arrangements of this neutral base.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Bridging Mind and Matter:** Offers an elegant potential solution to the mind-body problem by avoiding dualism and the reductionism of physicalism/idealism. Both mind and matter arise from a common source.
    *   **Potential for Unification:** Could potentially ground both the quantitative structure of physics and the qualitative nature of consciousness in the properties of the neutral elements. Russellian Monism (often classified here or under Panpsychism) specifically posits that physics describes the relational/structural properties of reality, while the intrinsic nature of that reality is experiential or proto-experiential.
    *   **Accommodating Physics & Consciousness:** A sufficiently versatile neutral base could, in principle, manifest as both physical structures (including QM phenomena, dark matter etc.) and conscious experience.
*   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**
    *   **Nature of the Neutral:** Defining the "neutral stuff" is notoriously difficult. What are its properties? How does it give rise to *both* physical structure *and* subjective quality? Without a clear specification, it risks being explanatorily empty.
    *   **Manifestation Problem:** How does the neutral base differentiate into the distinct realms of the physical and the mental? What determines whether a configuration of neutral elements manifests physically or mentally (or both)? This mirrors the combination problem in panpsychism and the emergence problem in physicalism.
    *   **Specific Scientific Puzzles:** Like idealism, it needs to explain *why* the specific laws and entities of physics (dark matter, black hole entropy, Amplituhedron structures) arise from the neutral base. How does the neutral base account for non-locality or the measurement problem?
*   **Rigor Assessment:** High conceptual appeal and potential explanatory unification. However, its rigor is hampered by the profound difficulty in characterizing the neutral base and explaining the mechanism of manifestation. It remains more of a promising framework or schema than a fully developed theory. Russellian variants offer more substance by linking intrinsic properties to consciousness.

**4. Panpsychism (Constitutive & Russellian Variants)**

*   **Core Thesis:** Consciousness (or proto-consciousness) is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. Complex consciousness (like human consciousness) arises from the combination of simpler conscious entities or properties.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **The Hard Problem:** Addresses the Hard Problem by grounding consciousness at the fundamental level, avoiding its emergence *ex nihilo* from non-conscious matter.
    *   **Naturalism:** Attempts to integrate consciousness into the natural world without resorting to supernatural dualism or the perceived explanatory failure of physicalism.
    *   **Russellian Monism Variant:** Integrates well with physics by suggesting physics describes the *extrinsic*, relational aspects of matter, while (proto-)consciousness constitutes its *intrinsic* nature.
*   **Weaknesses/Challenges:**
    *   **The Combination Problem:** This is the major hurdle. How do micro-level (proto-)conscious entities combine to form coherent macro-level consciousness? Why does combining subjects result in a *single*, unified subject rather than just a "heap" of consciousness? No widely accepted solution exists.
    *   **Explaining Specifics of Physics:** Generally doesn't offer direct explanations for QM interpretations, dark matter/energy, black hole paradoxes, or mathematical structures like the Amplituhedron, though some proponents might speculate connections (e.g., intrinsic nature influencing quantum measurement). Its primary focus is metaphysics of mind.
    *   **Empirical Testability:** It's difficult to conceive of empirical tests for micro-consciousness.
    *   **Palette Problem:** What kind of consciousness exists at the fundamental level? Is it highly diverse? How does it relate to the rich qualities of human experience?
*   **Rigor Assessment:** High rigor in taking consciousness seriously as a fundamental aspect of reality and attempting a naturalistic explanation. Its primary weakness is the severe and unsolved combination problem. Russellian variants improve coherence with physics but still face the combination problem. Its direct purchase on the specific physics puzzles mentioned is limited compared to physicalism or potentially idealism.

**Comparative Rigor & Conclusion**

No single framework emerges as definitively the *most* rigorous across all criteria without significant caveats. The assessment depends heavily on which problems one weighs most heavily:

*   **If prioritizing continuity with scientific methodology and empirical description:** Physicalism appears most rigorous, despite the glaring Hard Problem and interpretive difficulties in fundamental physics. It excels at *describing* the physical world but struggles to *explain* conscious experience within that description.
*   **If prioritizing a solution to the Hard Problem:** Analytic Idealism and Panpsychism/Neutral Monism seem more rigorous, as they address consciousness fundamentally. However, they face the significant challenge of explaining the emergence and detailed nature of the physical world from their proposed non-physical base (Idealism) or combining/manifesting consciousness (Panpsychism/Neutral Monism).
*   **Regarding specific physics puzzles:**
    *   **QM:** Idealism and potentially Neutral Monism offer more intuitively coherent interpretations for observer effects and non-locality, though they must still account for the mathematical formalism. Physicalism accommodates QM data but struggles with interpretation. Panpsychism has less direct impact.
    *   **Cosmology & Black Holes:** These remain primarily puzzles *within* the domain physicalism aims to describe. Idealism and Neutral Monism must show how these specific large-scale structures arise as appearances or manifestations. Panpsychism has little direct bearing.
    *   **Amplituhedron/Polytopes:** These mathematical structures challenge standard spacetime physicalism. They might fit better with Idealism (mental structures), Neutral Monism (fundamental neutral structures), or a radically revised Physicalism where spacetime is emergent from something more fundamental (information, geometry).

**Overall Assessment:**

Given the constraints (philosophical rigor, disregard mainstream status, address specific puzzles), frameworks that challenge physicalist orthodoxy currently demonstrate significant philosophical rigor *by directly confronting the Hard Problem and exploring alternative ontological groundings that might better accommodate puzzling aspects of physics (especially QM)*.

*   **Analytic Idealism:** Offers perhaps the most *radically different* but potentially consistent framework, solving the Hard Problem by default and offering novel views on QM. Its main challenge is rigorously deriving the physical world's specifics.
*   **Neutral Monism / Russellian Panpsychism:** These offer a promising *middle way*, attempting to unify mind and matter. Their rigor depends crucially on solving the specification/combination/manifestation problems.

Physicalism remains rigorous in its alignment with scientific practice but faces a potentially insurmountable hurdle with the Hard Problem, suggesting its ontology might be incomplete. Its solutions to physics puzzles are internal, but foundational interpretations remain debated.

Therefore, while Physicalism is the incumbent, **Analytic Idealism and Neutral Monism/Russellian Panpsychism display compelling philosophical rigor in their attempts to build a more comprehensive ontology that naturally incorporates consciousness and potentially offers new perspectives on physics' foundational issues, despite facing their own formidable challenges.** The "most" rigorous is debatable and depends on future theoretical developments and how one weighs the severity of the different explanatory challenges.
