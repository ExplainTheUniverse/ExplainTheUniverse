This is a fascinating and incredibly challenging question. Evaluating the "most philosophically rigorous" metaphysical framework involves subjective interpretations of rigor, completeness, and explanatory power, while also grappling with cutting-edge scientific mysteries. Thereâ€™s no single answer that will satisfy everyone, but here's my reasoned assessment, considering the criteria you've outlined:

**Defining Rigor (for this assessment):**

*   **Internal Consistency:** The framework must be logically coherent and free from internal contradictions.
*   **Explanatory Power:** It must explain a broad range of phenomena, including empirical observations in physics and consciousness science.
*   **Parsimony:** It should be as simple as possible while still accounting for the data (Occam's Razor).
*   **Openness to Revision:** Ideally, it should be adaptable to future scientific discoveries and theoretical developments.
*   **Ability to Address Objections:** A robust framework should acknowledge and proactively attempt to resolve its inherent challenges.
*   **Relevance to the Human Condition:** While not strictly necessary for rigor, the framework's relevance to questions of meaning, purpose, and value adds to its appeal.

**Framework Evaluations:**

Let's examine the frameworks you mentioned:

*   **Physicalism (Materialism):**
    *   **Description:** Reality is fundamentally composed of physical matter and energy, governed by physical laws. Consciousness is either an emergent property of complex physical systems (like the brain) or an illusion.
    *   **Strengths:** Aligns with much of modern science; simplicity in assuming one type of substance. Explains many physical phenomena effectively.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **The Hard Problem of Consciousness:**  Fails to explain *qualitative experience* (qualia).  How can subjective feelings arise solely from objective physical processes?  Explanatory gap remains.
        *   **Quantum Weirdness:**  While physicalism *describes* quantum phenomena, it doesn't necessarily *explain* their underlying nature.  The measurement problem, non-locality, and the emergence of classical reality from the quantum realm remain contentious.
        *   **Dark Matter/Energy:** While acknowledging these entities, materialism struggles to explain their composition and interaction with "ordinary" matter, raising questions about the "completeness" of the standard model.
    *   **Overall:** A widely held view within science, but faces significant philosophical hurdles regarding consciousness and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Its explanatory power is questioned given the proportion of mass-energy that is "dark".

*   **Analytic Idealism:**
    *   **Description:**  Reality is fundamentally mental or conscious. Conscious experiences are basic, and the physical world is a manifestation of these experiences (or a complex set of informational relationships within consciousness). Often championed by Bernardo Kastrup.
    *   **Strengths:** Directly addresses the hard problem of consciousness by postulating that consciousness is fundamental. Can potentially offer a unified account of reality without a fundamental mind-matter duality.  Provides a framework for understanding subjective experience.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Cosmological Scale Problem:** How does one account for the vast scale and apparent objectivity of the universe arising from consciousness alone? Maintaining the apparent "independence" and predictability of the external world is a challenge.
        *   **Explaining Scientific Regularities:** Needs to account for the precise, mathematical regularities observed in physics.  Are these mathematical "laws" also inherent to consciousness? Why these laws and not others? Requires a robust theory of how the "dissociation" or "projection" of consciousness generates the physical world.
        *   **Testability:** Difficult to generate specific, falsifiable predictions that would distinguish it from other metaphysical frameworks.
    *   **Overall:** Provides an elegant solution to the mind-body problem but faces significant challenges in explaining the specific structure and behavior of the observed universe, and how one large consciousness can contain so many seemingly separate subjective perspectives within it.

*   **Neutral Monism:**
    *   **Description:**  Reality is composed of a single, fundamental substance that is neither purely mental nor purely physical, but "neutral."  Mind and matter are different arrangements or aspects of this neutral substance. Bertrand Russell and David Chalmers are notable proponents.
    *   **Strengths:** Offers a middle ground, avoiding the extremes of physicalism and idealism. Can potentially bridge the explanatory gap between the physical and mental. Allows for the possibility that the "intrinsic nature" of matter is conscious.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Characterizing the Neutral Substance:** What *is* this "neutral" substance? Describing its properties and how it gives rise to both mind and matter is a major challenge.  Often ends up feeling like a semantic trick rather than a true explanation.
        *   **The Combination Problem:**  How do discrete elements of neutral stuff combine to form complex conscious entities? Particularly problematic for accounts like panpsychism that stem from neutral monism.
        *   **Testability:** Difficult to design experiments that would directly probe the nature of the neutral substance.
    *   **Overall:** A plausible alternative, but fundamentally relies on further specification of the neutral substance and the mechanisms by which it generates both mental and physical phenomena. A solution to the hard problem demands more than name-dropping.

*   **Panpsychism:**
    *   **Description:**  Consciousness, or some proto-conscious element, is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality, present even in basic physical entities.  More complex consciousness arises from the combination of these simpler conscious elements.  A frequent companion to neutral monism.
    *   **Strengths:** A direct response to the hard problem. Avoids emergence - it's always there, just in different forms. Aligns with some interpretations of quantum mechanics that suggest a role for observation in shaping reality.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **The Combination Problem:** How do countless micro-conscious entities combine to form the unified consciousness of a human being?  This is a formidable problem, and no convincing solution has been offered.
        *   **Defining the "Proto-Conscious" Element:** What *exactly* is the nature of this fundamental consciousness in, say, an electron? Vague definitions leave the theory open to criticism.
        *   **Explanatory Power:** It doesn't inherently explain *why* consciousness combines in specific ways (to create a human, for example). Why not just a random jumble of subjective experiences?
        *   **Testability:**  Extremely difficult to test directly.
    *   **Overall:** While intuitively appealing to some, the combination problem and lack of specific predictions significantly hamper its philosophical rigor.

**Addressing Cutting-Edge Scientific Puzzles:**

The frameworks' ability to address the puzzles you list is crucial for a rigorous assessment:

*   **Quantum Non-Locality & Measurement Problem:**
    *   *Idealism* and *panpsychism* can offer interpretations where consciousness plays a role in collapsing the wavefunction or connecting entangled particles, but these interpretations are highly speculative and usually lack detail.
    *   *Physicalism* typically tries to explain these phenomena through decoherence and interpretations of quantum mechanics like Many-Worlds, though these don't necessarily resolve the fundamental mystery of measurement.
    *   *Neutral Monism* might suggest that the "neutral substance" mediates entanglement, but this remains a placeholder unless the substance is defined more explicitly.

*   **Dark Matter and Dark Energy:**
    *   No current metaphysical framework provides a definitive explanation for dark matter/energy. These are primarily problems for physics, requiring new theories of gravity or particle physics.
    *   A sufficiently advanced and speculative *idealist* theory might propose that dark matter/energy are manifestations of underlying conscious activity, but this is purely speculative.

*   **Black Hole Information Paradox:**
    *   Again, primarly a physics problem. String theory and holographic principle are key approaches.
    *   *Some* interpretations of *analytic idealism* might suggest that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the "simulated" physics within consciousness and the underlying conscious reality, but this requires significant further development.

*   **Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes:**
    *   These are mathematical structures suggesting potential new ways to understand particle interactions and the early universe.  They are relevant because they hint at a deeper, more fundamental level of reality.
    *   Metaphysical frameworks can be used to *interpret* the implications of these structures. For example, an *idealist* might see them as evidence that the universe is ultimately based on informational relationships rather than physical particles. A *physicalist* might see them as pointing towards more fundamental components of physical reality.

**The Verdict (My Assessment):**

While *no* framework is entirely satisfactory, and each has significant drawbacks, I believe **neutral monism, particularly when combined with a form of panpsychism *that can somehow address the combination problem*, offers the most promising avenue for a philosophically rigorous account of reality at present.**  Here's why:

1.  **Bridging the Gap:** It directly attempts to address the hard problem without resorting to extreme positions like physicalism's denial of qualia or idealism's explanatory challenges regarding the objective world.
2.  **Potential for Integration:**  It *potentially* could be leveraged to integrate quantum mechanics and consciousness.  If the "neutral substance" has properties related to information processing or observation, it *could* offer a framework for understanding the measurement problem.
3.   **Openness to Revision:**  Neutral monism is intrinsically open to revision as our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality evolves.  The exact nature of the "neutral substance" is left unspecified, allowing for adaptation to new scientific discoveries.

**Important Caveats:**

*   This is a reasoned assessment based on current knowledge. Future scientific breakthroughs could dramatically alter the landscape.
*   The success of neutral monism/panpsychism hinges on solving the combination problem and providing a more concrete description of the "neutral substance." Without that, it remains a promising but unfulfilled promise.
*   My assessment prioritizes explanatory power and the ability to address the hard problem of consciousness. Others might prioritize parsimony or alignment with established scientific paradigms.

**In conclusion, while I lean toward an ambitious, but still unproven combination of neutral monism and panpsychism, I recognize that current understanding of science and philosophy is not complete enough to definitively evaluate the best metaphysical framework.**
