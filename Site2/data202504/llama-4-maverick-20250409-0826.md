To determine the most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework that offers a comprehensive account of reality, we must analyze various perspectives in the context of their ability to accommodate empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in both consciousness science and contemporary physics. The frameworks to be considered include analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other relevant perspectives.

1. **Analytic Idealism**: This framework posits that reality is fundamentally mental or experiential. It suggests that the physical world is a representation or manifestation of a more fundamental, mental reality. Analytic idealism can potentially provide a coherent explanation for the hard problem of consciousness by positing that consciousness is not an emergent property of physical processes but is instead fundamental. However, its compatibility with empirical findings in physics, such as quantum non-locality and the measurement problem, would depend on how it interprets these phenomena. If it can integrate these aspects into a coherent narrative that also explains consciousness, it could be considered robust.

2. **Neutral Monism**: Neutral monism posits that both mind and matter are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality that is neither purely mental nor purely physical. This perspective can potentially offer a unified explanation for both the nature of consciousness and the phenomena observed in physics. By positing a neutral fundamental reality, it can attempt to bridge the gap between the subjective experience and the objective physical world, potentially addressing the hard problem of consciousness and integrating findings from physics.

3. **Panpsychism**: Panpsychism suggests that consciousness or mental properties are fundamental and ubiquitous, present in all matter to some degree. This perspective directly addresses the hard problem of consciousness by making consciousness a basic feature of the universe. Variants of panpsychism, such as micro-panpsychism or cosmopsychism, offer different takes on how consciousness is distributed and combined. Panpsychism's ability to accommodate empirical findings in physics is variable, depending on its specific formulation and how it relates the fundamental consciousness to physical phenomena.

4. **Physicalism**: Physicalism posits that everything that exists can be explained in terms of physical phenomena and laws. While physicalism has been highly successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, it faces challenges in explaining the hard problem of consciousness and certain aspects of quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem and non-locality. Physicalism's strength lies in its compatibility with a vast body of empirical evidence from physics and other sciences, but its ability to fully account for subjective experience remains a subject of debate.

5. **Other Perspectives**: Other metaphysical frameworks, such as dualism and various forms of non-reductive physicalism, also have their strengths and weaknesses. Dualism, for example, posits the existence of two fundamental substances or realms (often mind and matter), which can help explain the hard problem of consciousness but may struggle with integrating findings from physics. Non-reductive physicalism attempts to maintain the primacy of physical reality while still acknowledging the complexity and irreducibility of conscious experience.

**Assessment**:

- **Accommodating the Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Analytic idealism, neutral monism, and panpsychism directly address the hard problem by making consciousness or mental properties fundamental. Physicalism struggles with this problem, as it requires explaining subjective experience in purely physical terms.

- **Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem**: Neutral monism and certain interpretations of panpsychism or analytic idealism could potentially offer novel insights into these phenomena by relating them to a more fundamental, unified reality. Physicalism can accommodate these phenomena through various interpretations of quantum mechanics, but the implications for a coherent metaphysics are still debated.

- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the Black Hole Information Paradox, the Amplituhedron, and Cosmological Polytopes**: These are areas where the implications of various metaphysical frameworks are less directly explored. However, a framework's ability to provide a coherent narrative that encompasses these phenomena could be seen as a mark of its philosophical rigor and comprehensiveness.

**Conclusion**:

The most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework is likely one that can coherently integrate insights from both consciousness science and contemporary physics. While no single framework perfectly accommodates all the challenges and findings, **neutral monism** and **analytic idealism** show particular promise due to their potential to address both the hard problem of consciousness and various puzzles in physics in a unified manner. Neutral monism, in particular, offers a versatile framework that can be developed in various ways to accommodate different interpretations of physical phenomena and the nature of consciousness.

Ultimately, the choice between these frameworks will depend on how well they can be developed to provide a comprehensive, coherent, and empirically adequate account of reality. Ongoing debates and future research in both metaphysics and the sciences will be crucial in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.
