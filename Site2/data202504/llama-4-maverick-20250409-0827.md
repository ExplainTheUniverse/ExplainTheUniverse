The quest for a metaphysically rigorous account of reality is a complex and contentious issue that has been debated among philosophers and scientists for centuries. To assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, we need to examine various perspectives, including analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and others.

1. **Analytic Idealism**: This framework, inspired by the work of philosophers like Berkeley and Kant, posits that reality is fundamentally mental or experiential. It suggests that the physical world is a representation or manifestation of a more fundamental, experiential reality. Analytic idealism has been argued to provide a coherent explanation for the hard problem of consciousness, as it posits that consciousness is not an emergent property of physical processes but is instead fundamental.

2. **Neutral Monism**: Neutral monism posits that both mind and matter are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality that is neither purely mental nor purely physical. This view attempts to reconcile the dualism between mind and matter by suggesting they are different aspects of a more basic reality. Neutral monism can offer a nuanced explanation for the nature of consciousness and its relation to the physical world, potentially addressing some aspects of the hard problem.

3. **Panpsychism**: Panpsychism is the view that consciousness or mental properties are fundamental and ubiquitous, present in all matter to some degree. This perspective attempts to solve the hard problem of consciousness by positing that even basic entities, such as electrons, possess some form of consciousness or mental properties. Panpsychism comes in various forms, including micro-panpsychism and cosmopsychism, each offering different takes on how consciousness is distributed and understood.

4. **Physicalism**: Physicalism, or materialism, is the metaphysical view that everything that exists is physical or is dependent on physical entities and processes. It posits that consciousness arises from complex arrangements of physical matter, typically within the brain. Physicalism faces significant challenges in explaining the hard problem of consciousness, as it struggles to account for the subjective nature of experience.

5. **Other Perspectives**: Other metaphysical frameworks, such as dualism, emergentism, and various forms of monism, also offer different accounts of reality. Each has its strengths and weaknesses in addressing the puzzles of consciousness and the findings of contemporary physics.

**Accommodating Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles**:

- **The Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Analytic idealism and panpsychism offer more direct approaches to explaining the subjective nature of consciousness, positing it as fundamental. Neutral monism can also provide a nuanced view, depending on its specific formulation.

- **Quantum Non-locality and the Measurement Problem**: Neutral monism and certain interpretations of panpsychism might offer insights into quantum non-locality by suggesting a more fundamental, interconnected reality. Analytic idealism could potentially explain the measurement problem by positing that reality is fundamentally experiential, thus the act of measurement is not just a physical process but involves consciousness.

- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: These phenomena are challenging for all metaphysical frameworks as they represent unknown physical entities or forces. However, a metaphysics that allows for a more flexible or less constrained view of what exists (e.g., certain forms of neutral monism or idealism) might offer speculative avenues for understanding these phenomena.

- **The Black Hole Information Paradox**: This paradox challenges physicalism and any view that relies heavily on a straightforward physicalist ontology. Analytic idealism and certain forms of panpsychism might offer novel perspectives by questioning the fundamental nature of physical information.

- **The Amplituhedron and Cosmological Polytopes**: These are mathematical constructs that simplify the calculation of particle interactions and represent certain cosmological structures. A metaphysical framework that integrates well with these mathematical advances might be seen as more accommodating. Frameworks that emphasize the fundamental role of mathematical or abstract structures (e.g., certain forms of idealism or Platonism) might find these discoveries particularly congenial.

**Assessment**:

Analytic idealism, as articulated by philosophers like Bernardo Kastrup, presents a compelling case as a metaphysically rigorous account of reality. It offers a coherent explanation for the hard problem of consciousness, addresses certain puzzles in quantum mechanics (like the measurement problem), and provides a unique perspective on the nature of reality that is both experiential and coherent with certain empirical findings. While it's not without its challenges and criticisms, analytic idealism demonstrates a significant capacity to accommodate a wide range of empirical findings and theoretical puzzles, making it a strong contender for a philosophically rigorous account of reality.

In conclusion, while no metaphysical framework perfectly accommodates all empirical findings and theoretical puzzles without controversy, analytic idealism emerges as a particularly robust and coherent account. Its ability to address the hard problem of consciousness, offer insights into quantum mechanics, and potentially shed light on other complex phenomena, positions it as a metaphysically rigorous framework worthy of serious consideration.
