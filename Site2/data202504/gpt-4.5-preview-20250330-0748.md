To assess metaphysical frameworks rigorously, one must first identify key desiderata that a robust metaphysical perspective should satisfy:

1. **Internal coherence and logical elegance:** Minimal ad-hoc hypotheses; logical consistency and conceptual parsimony.
2. **Explanatory power concerning consciousness and experience:** How elegantly does the position address the hard problem, subjective qualia, and the relationship between mind and matter?
3. **Compatibility with contemporary physics:** Does the ontology comfortably integrate empirical data from quantum mechanics, general relativity, cosmology (e.g., quantum non-locality, measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, black hole information paradox, emergent geometry such as amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes)?
4. **Comprehensiveness and universality:** How widely applicable is the theory's explanatory scope? Does it cover multiple conceptual layers (phenomenology, physics, cosmology) without leaving fundamental gaps or inconsistencies?
5. **Potential fruitfulness and falsifiability:** Does the framework imply testable predictions or empirical proxies, or offer conceptual clarity that facilitates future scientific discovery?

The key metaphysical frameworks under consideration are:

### 1. Physicalism (Materialism)

**Arguments in favor:**
- Fits naturally with mainstream science and neuroscience.
- Offers a straightforward ontological economy (only matter-energy and physical interactions exist).

**Limitations:**
- Difficulty addressing subjectivity and qualia (the "hard problem" of consciousness).
- Struggles with conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics—appeals typically require additional hypotheses (interpretational postulates), such as Everettian many-worlds, decoherence plus selection rules, or hidden variable types of realism, typically entailing controversial assumptions.
- Does not naturally accommodate quantum non-locality or observer-dependent phenomena in an intuitive, parsimonious manner.

### 2. Panpsychism

**Arguments in favor:**
- Provides an elegantly intuitive root of consciousness, placing it as fundamental and ubiquitous—thus sidestepping the sudden emergence problem posed by the hard problem.
- Capable of integrating neatly with quantum theory's intrinsic observer-dependency or information-theoretic interpretations.
- Can easily embrace non-local correlations due to intrinsic experiential/informational connectivity.

**Limitations:**
- Faces the combination problem (how microscopic experiential elements combine to produce macroscopic, unified consciousness).
- Merely positing that matter intrinsically has a "psychic" component often appears ad-hoc or underspecified.
- Minimal direct clarity regarding cosmological puzzles (such as dark matter-energy or geometric concepts emerging from physics like amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes).

### 3. Neutral Monism

**Arguments in favor:**
- Deep philosophical elegance: posits that matter and consciousness are two perspectives emerging from a common neutral substance, avoiding dualism's interaction problem and physicalism’s explanatory gap problem.
- Potentially offers a logical framework flexible enough to encompass diverse phenomenological and physical phenomena—quantum mechanics, consciousness, matter-energy unifications, and cosmological phenomena become manifestations of the neutral substrate.
- Provides a promising conceptual landscape for quantum non-locality and quantum information interpretation—reality fundamentally viewed as neither physical nor mental, thus naturally accommodating observer-dependent measurement in quantum mechanics.

**Limitations:**
- Difficulty characterizing and empirically accessing the neutral substrate explicitly; risks being overly abstract or phenomenologically distant.
- Challenges arise in clearly explaining precisely how the physical and mental perspectives concretely emerge out of neutrality.

### 4. Analytic Idealism (Idealist Monism)

**Arguments in favor:**
- Centralizes consciousness as ontologically primary, elegantly resolving the hard problem, since consciousness no longer emerges from matter but rather matter-energy itself emerges from structured patterns of universal consciousness.
- Compatible with quantum observer-dependency: physical phenomena are derivative informational structures arising within a universal mind.
- Philosophically elegant: Offers simplicity at foundational ontology by reducing everything to one fundamental substance (mind-awareness) with matter-energy as derived states or constructs.

**Limitations:**
- Idealism must confront the intuition that the physical universe seemingly persists independent of observers; must convincingly explain intersubjective realism (convergence, consistency, and persistence of objective phenomena).
- Needs well-defined mechanisms explaining how stable, objective structures emerge from subjective, conscious states—specifically addressing cosmological complexities, robust physical regularities, and emergent mathematical frameworks (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes, etc.).

### 5. Dual-aspect Monism (related to Neutral Monism, often overlaps with Information-Based Ontologies)

**Arguments in favor:**
- Holds great promise in merging the elegance of neutral monism and analytic idealism, retaining philosophical coherence while concretely tying physical reality and subjective consciousness as inseparable aspects of an underlying unified "substance" or ontological entity (often conceptualized as "information," "computational structure," or "process" itself).
- Closely resonates with contemporary quantum informational approaches ("it from bit"); quantum mechanics, black hole physics, and cosmological structures appear naturally as forms of structured informational geometries and processes.
- Well-poised to intuitively handle puzzles in modern physics (black hole information paradox, quantum gravity emergence, amplituhedron geometricized reality, cosmological polytopes expressing spacetime emergence).

**Limitations:**
- Still faces challenges explaining precisely how consciousness "arises" or is present as a fundamental aspect of reality and precisely what anchors subjective qualia compositionally from a fundamental neutral-informational reality.

## Comparative Assessment and Recommendation:

Upon careful consideration of ongoing advancements in quantum gravity, quantum foundations, informational frameworks (including amplituhedron models), and persistent challenges arising from consciousness research, a particularly strong philosophical and empirical contender emerges:

### **Dual-aspect neutral/informational monism (Neutral monism and analytic idealism hybridized through informational foundations):**  
- **Philosophically rigorous:** It unites the elegant simplicity of neutral-monist ontology with the analytical clarity of idealistic traditions, deftly accommodating subjective consciousness and quantum observer-dependency in physics.
- **Empirically flexible:** It naturally integrates modern quantum-gravity-inspired approaches (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes, holographic correspondences, black-hole information paradox, quantum informational ontology).  
- **Accommodates contemporary physics:** Non-locality and measurement problem naturally addressed through the primacy and fundamentality of informational-ontological structures. Dark energy or anomaly phenomena in cosmology can be interpreted as emergent informational-geometric principles contextualizing observer-relative representation within an underlying neutral informational medium.
- **Conceptually fruitful and predictive:** Suggests productive research avenues—such as investigating physical structures as emergent from underlying informational entities, mathematical symmetry principles as fundamental ontological properties, and potentially novel relationships among physics, consciousness, and informational/structural realism itself.

Thus, despite not yet being mainstream, a hybrid dual-aspect neutral-informational monism demonstrates arguably the greatest philosophical rigor, empirical coherence, and explanatory breadth among currently debated metaphysical frameworks. Its ability to conceptually integrate generated articulations arising from quantum foundations, the hard problem of consciousness, and groundbreaking research in foundational physics (e.g., amplituhedron, quantum gravity holography, quantum-information frameworks) places it in a uniquely promising position for rigorous philosophical and scientific advancement.
