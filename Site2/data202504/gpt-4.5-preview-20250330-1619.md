To meaningfully evaluate which metaphysical system offers the most philosophically rigorous account, we must analyze how each framework accommodates deep foundational questions posed by contemporary philosophy and physics. Key among these challenges are:

1. The hard problem of consciousness (why and how subjective experience arises)  
2. Quantum mechanics paradoxes (measurement problem, non-locality, quantum entanglement)  
3. Fundamental cosmological phenomena and anomalies (dark matter, dark energy, black hole information paradox, cosmological and mathematical structures like the amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes, and emerging concepts of fundamental physics)

Below, we examine how major metaphysical positions—physicalism, analytic idealism, panpsychism, neutral monism, and others—stand in relation to these advanced questions.

## 1. Physicalism (Materialism)

**Core Idea:**  
Reality is fundamentally physical (matter-energy-space-time), and consciousness is ultimately explicable in terms of physical processes or states.

**Strengths:**
- Widely accepted due to compatibility with natural science.
- Provides a clear explanatory model for empirically measurable phenomena.
- Powerful predictive frameworks: neuroscience, cognitive science, physics.

**Problems and Limitations:**
- Difficulty addressing the "hard problem" of consciousness (Chalmers), i.e., subjectivity and qualia are notoriously resistant to reduction to physical descriptions.
- Often enmeshed in interpretations of quantum mechanics requiring interpretations like many-worlds or decoherence theories, which introduce conceptual baggage.
- Quantum measurement problem and quantum non-locality defy straightforward classical intuitions within strict physicalist narratives; interpretations can seem ad hoc (e.g. many-worlds, spontaneous collapse theories).

**Assessment:**  
Physicalism is strong in empirical grounding yet repeatedly struggles philosophically at the intersection with consciousness and quantum foundational problems. To remain coherent, physicalists adopt complicated reconciliation strategies (emergentism, functional reductionism, quantum interpretations) that sometimes feel philosophically vulnerable and incomplete.

## 2. Analytic Idealism

**Core Idea:**  
Reality is fundamentally mental or grounded in consciousness ("Mind" as fundamental substrate). The physical universe emerges as a projection, expression, or modality of collective mental states or conscious structures.

**Strengths:**
- Provides elegant resolution to the hard problem. Consciousness is fundamental, not emergent, bypassing explanatory gaps.
- Quantum mechanics (observer effects, measurement problem, non-locality) may make sense in a universe constituted by mental qualities as fundamental structures and observational interactions defined within a universal consciousness field.
- Can easily integrate non-spatial, abstract mathematical objects like amplituhedra or cosmological polytopes as aspects of a fundamental mental or Platonic domain.

**Problems and Limitation:**
- Faces intuitive resistance due to perceived "reverse causality" (mind creates matter rather than vice versa).
- Requires clarification on how shared objective structures arise from private subjectivity (intersubjective consistency).
- Empirical testability and predictive precision in physics must be carefully constructed to maintain rigorous explanatory power. Often accused of being speculative or too flexible.

**Assessment:**  
Analytic idealism excels philosophically by naturally resolving foundational puzzles (hard problem, quantum measurement), but struggles in empirical rigor and predictive specificity. Still, philosophically rigorous and elegant, but empirical strength requires substantial conceptual elaboration.

## 3. Panpsychism

**Core Idea:**  
Basic constituents of physical reality possess intrinsic subjective aspects or proto-conscious properties. Consciousness permeates nature from fundamental particles to complex organisms.

**Strengths:**
- Directly accommodates the hard problem; consciousness is universal as basic property, removing strict emergence.
- Can integrate quantum mechanics puzzling phenomena (non-locality, measurement) through intrinsic subjective interplay among fundamental entities.
- Easily reconciled at conceptual levels with contemporary mathematical structures (e.g., amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes), by positing these high-level mathematical forms as reflections of more fundamental conscious-like properties.

**Problems and Limitations:**
- Combination problem: how primitive consciousness or proto-conscious units combine into complex unified conscious beings.
- Ambiguity regarding interaction of subjective and objective within fundamental physics—needs more careful formal elaboration to attain full empirical rigor.

**Assessment:**  
Panpsychism is promising in philosophical rigor by neutralizing the hard problem, but faces nontrivial philosophical and empirical puzzles like the combination problem. Still, it holds great promise for accommodating quantum foundations and mathematical abstractions consistently.

## 4. Neutral Monism

**Core idea:**  
Reality fundamentally consists of a neutral substance or property neither exclusively physical nor mental. Both consciousness and matter emerge from or correspond to this neutral fundamental level.

**Strengths:**
- Avoids dualism and extreme positions by positing a single underlying neutral substrate.
- Can flexibly integrate conscious and physical domains, thus addressing consciousness puzzles and quantum ontological issues more comfortably.
- Potential for elegantly accommodating advanced mathematical cosmological constructs into its neutral framework as intrinsic structural forms.

**Problems and Limitations:**
- Ambiguity: Clearly defining the nature of this "neutral" substrate, and how distinct mental and physical facets derive from it, is philosophically challenging.
- Potential difficulty in empirical predictions and testability beyond philosophical appeal.
- Risks remaining overly abstract, making it unclear how exactly this neutral entity maps effectively onto physical and mental phenomena.

**Assessment:**  
Neutral monism possesses conceptual elegance and minimal metaphysical assumptions. However, greater precision is necessary in specifying the exact nature of the neutral entity to make it a truly rigorous explanatory metaphysics without falling prey to vagueness.

## 5. Cosmopsychism and Other Integrative Approaches

**Cosmopsychism (variant of idealism/panpsychism):**  
Suggests the universe itself is conscious, and individual consciousness is derivative from a universal mind-like structure.

- Provides explicit answers to cosmological puzzles (dark energy, quantum non-locality) by providing universal consciousness as a cohesive, fundamental field.
- Very promising for integrating phenomena like quantum entanglement, black hole information paradox, holography, and contemporary cosmological mathematics into a single, elegant explanatory paradigm.
- Still, faces formidable philosophical and empirical puzzles in firmly establishing the relationship between universal and individual consciousness rigorously.

## Concluding Remark on the Most Philosophically Rigorous Option

No metaphysical stance conclusively addresses every philosophical difficulty perfectly yet. However, given the current scientific-philosophical puzzles, analytic idealism, panpsychism, neutral monism, and cosmopsychism offer significantly greater philosophical rigor and internal coherence compared to standard physicalism.

In particular, **analytic idealism and cosmopsychism** stand out for their elegant conceptual resolutions of quantum foundational paradoxes and the hard problem, in principle more comfortably integrating consciousness, quantum mechanics, and novel mathematical formalisms.  
Their key ongoing challenge is demonstrating empirical predictive power and gaining specified explanatory testability.

Considering the present state of contemporary knowledge, analytic idealism and cosmopsychism appear philosophically most rigorous in providing coherent, explanatory frameworks aligned well with contemporary philosophical and scientific puzzles, despite their relative lack of mainstream acceptance at present.
