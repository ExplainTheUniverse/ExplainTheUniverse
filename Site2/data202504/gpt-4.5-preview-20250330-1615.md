A rigorous evaluation of metaphysical frameworks demands examining their ability to coherently and parsimoniously address phenomenological experience (the hard problem of consciousness), empirical observations from modern physics, and theoretical coherence with emerging mathematical and cosmological frameworks. Let's outline key frameworks—analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism—and assess their explanatory strengths and limitations vis-à-vis consciousness and contemporary physics.

## 1. Preliminary Considerations for Philosophical Rigor
Before diving into specific viewpoints, philosophical rigor demands that a viable metaphysical framework offer:
- **Ontological Parsimony:** Minimal assumptions and maximal explanatory power.
- **Explanatory Scope:** Robust explanation of consciousness, empirical results of physics, cosmological observations, and mathematics.
- **Empirical Compatibility:** Ability to integrate empirical results without ad hoc maneuvers.
- **Conceptual Clarity and Internal Consistency:** Lacking contradictions, ambiguity, or unexplained dualisms or gaps.

## 2. Overview of Major Metaphysical Frameworks
  
### A. **Physicalism / Materialism**
Physicalism posits that reality consists fundamentally of matter-energy as described by physics; consciousness emerges from complex neural (or functional) activity.

**Strengths:**
- Highly compatible with classical empirical science (neuroscience, biology, classical physics).
- Parsimonious within classical frameworks (no need for special consciousness-stuff; physical entities suffice).

**Weaknesses:**
- Struggles deeply with the "Hard Problem of Consciousness" (why/how conscious experiences arise from purely physical interactions). Physicalism currently offers explanations of correlation or structure-function, but not experience itself.
- Faces conceptual challenges related to quantum mechanics, such as quantum non-locality or the measurement problem. Standard physicalism typically relies implicitly on classical intuitions about locality and separability, challenged increasingly by quantum entanglement.
- Dark matter, dark energy, and black hole information paradox do not refute physicalism but caution us toward humility about our completeness of physical theories. Yet these physical mysteries do not directly address consciousness or phenomenology.

**Overall Evaluation:**  
Physicalism retains popularity by being empirically focused and scientifically successful. However, its inability to account adequately for subjective conscious experience or quantum anomalies like measurement and nonlocality weakens its philosophical robustness significantly.

### B. **Panpsychism**
Panpsychism argues experience or proto-consciousness is fundamental, ubiquitous, intrinsic, and irreducible. It suggests that consciousness did not "emerge"; instead it has always been at the foundational level of reality itself.

**Strengths:**
- Addresses elegantly the Hard Problem of Consciousness by positing subjectivity fundamentally. Consciousness does not mysteriously emerge from non-experiential matter; rather, matter intrinsically holds experiential or proto-experiential nature.
- Can be integrated with contemporary physics, serving as a philosophical background within which quantum processes (such as measurement-mediated collapse, observer-dependence, and nonlocality) may appear less puzzling. Quantum phenomena involving observer participation become intrinsic rather than anomalous.

**Weaknesses:**
- Faces "combination problem": how fundamental proto-experiential bits combine into unified macroscopic conscious experiences.
- Still requires bridging from physics’ mathematical language into experience, even if experience is fundamental.
- Unclear how cosmological puzzles like dark energy, dark matter, black hole information paradox, and amplituhedron-linked geometric frameworks directly connect to subjective, intrinsic experiential elements.

**Overall Evaluation:**  
Panpsychism makes a considerable leap forward in solving the phenomenological puzzle but seems incomplete or strained in explaining the blending of small subjective experiences into cohesive macroscopic conscious states. Quantum-related puzzles can fit snugly here, but still leaves some cosmological/mathematical questions unanswered.

### C. **Neutral Monism**
Neutral monism suggests existence fundamentally consists of neutral "stuff" neither intrinsically physical nor mental. Both consciousness and matter are manifestations or different perspectives on this neutral substrate.

**Strengths:**
- Has potential explanatory capability for both the physical (empirical physics) and the mental (subjective experience).
- Flexible enough to accommodate modern physics, as quantum reality, particles/waves, observers/observed collapsers could be viewed tentatively as perspectives/modes arising from a unified substrate.
- Offers an ontologically elegant approach to both quantum phenomena and consciousness, without committing to strong dualism or reductionism.

**Weaknesses:**
- The nature of “neutral stuff” remains vague—neutrality often seen as insufficiently defined, risking emptiness or linguistic ambiguity.
- Challenge with contemporary fundamental physics: Dark matter, cosmological geometry (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes) and black hole information paradoxes still require detailed bridging principles within a neutral monist framework.

**Overall Evaluation:**  
Neutral monism enjoys broad explanatory potential. Yet without clearer conceptualization of the exact nature of the neutral substrate or how these differing perspectives (mental vs. physical) arise, it remains somewhat unfinished and abstract.

### D. **Analytic Idealism**
Analytic Idealism claims consciousness (or Mind-at-Large, universal mind) is fundamental, and physical reality—including spacetime, quantum fields, and matter—is emergent from mental structures within universal consciousness.

**Strengths:**
- Explicitly addresses the Hard Problem of Consciousness by identifying fundamental reality as inherently experiential/conscious.
- Particularly compatible with quantum mechanics’ "observer-centeredness," measurement problem, entanglement/nonlocality, and rupture of classical realism, especially with interpretations like QBism, von Neumann/Wigner-type collapse theories, or idealist-inclined ontologies.
- Potentially offers parsimonious explanation of the mathematical emergence of physical reality out of mental structures: advanced ideas such as amplituhedron or cosmological polytopes could be interpreted as mental constructs within a universal consciousness framework.

**Weaknesses:**
- Traditional scientific realism is often hard to reconcile seamlessly with idealistic accounts that depict physical reality as derivative from purely mental phenomena. Empirical verification or falsification can be unclear.
- Difficulty in explaining inter-subjective coherence and objectivity without invoking intricate hypotheses about universal consciousness and the individuation of personal consciousness.

**Overall Evaluation:**  
Analytic Idealism demonstrates superior philosophical rigor around consciousness and quantum mysteries; however, to become fully rigorous, it demands clarification on how universal consciousness generates stable, consistent, mathematically precise physical universes and cosmological realities.

## 3. Comprehensive Meta-analysis: Comparative Assessment
- **Physicalism:** Empirically strong but consciousness and quantum mechanics clearly problematic.
- **Panpsychism:** Addresses consciousness well, and somewhat quantum mechanics, but combination problem remains unsolved.
- **Neutral Monism:** Flexible and appealing, yet unclear in ontology; central question is to define clearly the neutral basis.
- **Analytic Idealism:** Capably addresses deep philosophical puzzles—hard problem and quantum measurement—but needs clarification against realism/objectivity questions within physics.

## 4. Tentative Conclusion Regarding Philosophical Rigor
No single framework yet fully resolves all these puzzles definitively and with full philosophical rigor. Nonetheless, weighing the criteria carefully:

- **Physicalism** is increasingly problematic as an ontological framework given its inability to explain consciousness and quantum paradoxes convincingly.
- **Panpsychism** and **Neutral Monism** are strong contenders offering partial, sophisticated explanatory advances yet falling short particularly around combination and ontology-definitions.
- **Analytic Idealism, despite less mainstream acceptance, provides arguably the most philosophically coherent explanation for consciousness and accommodates quantum phenomena elegantly.** Even advanced mathematical structures such as amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes could logically be consistent with a universal-mind-like "structuralist platonism" inherent in idealism.

Therefore, carefully weighing the criteria, **a sophisticated analytic idealism or neutral monism—particularly analytic idealism—is well positioned philosophically and logically to provide the most rigorous account of reality.** Though currently less mainstream, this approach most coherently addresses metaphysical puzzles, consciousness, and fundamental physics phenomena simultanously.
