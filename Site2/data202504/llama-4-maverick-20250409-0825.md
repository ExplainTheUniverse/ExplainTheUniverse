Assessing the most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework requires a comprehensive evaluation of various perspectives, including their ability to accommodate empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics. The frameworks under consideration are analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and others.

1. **Analytic Idealism**: This framework posits that reality is fundamentally mental or experiential. It attempts to reconcile idealism with the rigor of analytic philosophy. Analytic idealism can offer insightful perspectives on the hard problem of consciousness by suggesting that consciousness is not an emergent property but a fundamental aspect of reality. However, its ability to fully accommodate empirical findings and puzzles in physics, such as quantum non-locality and the measurement problem, is less clear and requires further development.

2. **Neutral Monism**: Neutral monism posits that both mind and matter are manifestations of a more fundamental substance or reality that is neither mental nor physical. This framework can potentially offer a unified explanation for both the nature of consciousness and the phenomena observed in physics. Neutral monism is well-suited to addressing the hard problem of consciousness and can also provide a coherent perspective on quantum non-locality and the measurement problem by suggesting that the fundamental reality underlies both conscious experience and physical phenomena.

3. **Panpsychism**: Panpsychism asserts that consciousness or mental properties are fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world. It comes in various forms, including micro-panpsychism, which attributes consciousness to fundamental particles, and panprotopsychism, which attributes proto-conscious properties to fundamental entities. Panpsychism directly addresses the hard problem of consciousness and can be seen as compatible with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, where the fundamental entities could be considered as having mental or proto-mental properties.

4. **Physicalism**: Physicalism posits that everything that exists is physical or is dependent on physical entities and processes. While physicalism has been successful in explaining many phenomena, it faces challenges in addressing the hard problem of consciousness. Physicalism struggles to explain why we have subjective experiences at all. The emergence of consciousness from purely physical processes remains a significant puzzle.

5. **Other Perspectives**: Other metaphysical frameworks include dualism, which posits the existence of two fundamental substances (mind and matter); emergentism, which suggests that consciousness emerges from complex physical systems; and various forms of monism and pluralism.

**Evaluation**:

- **Accommodation of Empirical Findings and Theoretical Puzzles**:
  - **Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Analytic idealism, neutral monism, and panpsychism directly address this issue by considering consciousness as fundamental or ubiquitous.
  - **Quantum Non-Locality and the Measurement Problem**: Neutral monism and certain interpretations of panpsychism offer frameworks that can accommodate these phenomena by positing a fundamental, unified reality that underlies both quantum mechanics and conscious experience.
  - **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**: These phenomena are more directly related to the physical universe and its evolution. While not directly addressed by the metaphysical frameworks, a framework like neutral monism might provide a more unified view that could encompass these phenomena within a broader understanding of reality.
  - **Black Hole Information Paradox and the Amplituhedron**: These are challenges to our understanding of physics, particularly quantum gravity and the nature of spacetime. A metaphysical framework that unifies the understanding of space, time, and matter, such as certain versions of neutral monism or panpsychism, might offer insights or a backdrop for understanding these phenomena.
  - **Cosmological Polytopes**: These are related to the structure of scattering amplitudes in physics. A metaphysical framework that integrates physical and experiential aspects could potentially offer novel perspectives on the fundamental structure of reality that underlies such phenomena.

**Conclusion**:

Neutral monism appears to be a highly promising metaphysical framework due to its potential to offer a unified explanation for both the nature of consciousness and various phenomena in physics. It accommodates the hard problem of consciousness by positing a fundamental reality that underlies both mind and matter. Neutral monism can also provide coherent perspectives on quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, and potentially other puzzles in physics, by suggesting a unified, underlying reality. While it requires further development to fully address all empirical findings and theoretical puzzles, its integrative potential makes it a philosophically rigorous account of reality.

Other frameworks, like analytic idealism and panpsychism, also offer valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and can be seen as compatible with certain physical phenomena. However, their ability to provide a comprehensive explanation for the full range of empirical findings and theoretical puzzles may be more limited compared to neutral monism.

Physicalism, while successful in many areas, faces significant challenges in addressing the hard problem of consciousness and may struggle to provide a complete account of reality that encompasses both physical phenomena and conscious experience.

Ultimately, the most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework will depend on ongoing developments in both metaphysics and the sciences, as well as the ability of these frameworks to accommodate new findings and to provide a coherent, comprehensive understanding of reality.
