Below is one way of approaching the issue, though it’s important to stress that in metaphysics there is no unanimous “winner.” Instead, one may compare how each framework fares when pressed by both empirical findings and conceptual puzzles. I will discuss physicalism, panpsychism, analytic idealism, and neutral monism in turn, and then indicate which seems to strike an especially promising balance between rigor and breadth.

1. Physicalism

• What it offers: Physicalism holds that all that exists is physical. Its strength lies in its close alignment with and success in natural science. The methods of experimental physics and neuroscience are built on the assumption that the world is, at its most basic level, physical. Over many years, physicalism has been refined to explain nearly every observable phenomenon.

• Challenges: Despite its empirical successes, physicalism is often criticized for its difficulty in accounting for subjective experience – the so‐called “hard problem” of consciousness. Moreover, many of the conceptual challenges emerging from contemporary physics, such as the measurement problem or the puzzles of quantum non-locality, may seem to call for a deeper metaphysical understanding than can be provided by “brute facts” of physical states alone. The same goes for cosmological puzzles incorporated in concepts such as dark matter and dark energy, or even newer geometric formalisms like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytopes, which hint at foundational structures not immediately identifiable with classical “matter.”

2. Panpsychism

• What it offers: Panpsychism posits that even the most elementary constituents of matter have some form of experiential or proto‐conscious quality. In doing so, it shifts the explanatory burden of consciousness by making experience ubiquitous rather than emergent from complex physical arrangements. This approach can potentially turn the “hard problem” on its head by viewing consciousness as an intrinsic part of reality rather than an epiphenomenon.

• Challenges: While increasingly popular among some philosophers and even some neuroscientists, panpsychism remains speculative in terms of precise empirical predictions. How, for example, do the “micro‐experiences” attributed to particles combine to produce the rich tapestry of human consciousness? And while intriguing, it is still debated how panpsychism might address the detailed technical issues of quantum measurement or the geometric puzzles in high‐energy physics.

3. Analytic Idealism

• What it offers: Analytic idealism – as defended by thinkers such as Bernardo Kastrup – argues that the fundamental substrate of reality is mental rather than physical, with the world of objects emerging as representations within a universal consciousness. This framework has the appeal of offering an integrated account of both matter and mind; what we call physical phenomena (postulated to underlie quantum phenomena such as non-locality or even features like the amplituhedron) become secondary structures emerging within a mental field.

• Challenges: Critics point out that analytic idealism can appear counterintuitive, especially if one is committed to a realist picture of the physical world. Furthermore, connecting the rich mathematics of contemporary physics (black hole information puzzles and the geometry of scattering amplitudes, for instance) to a primarily mental substance remains at an early stage of conceptual development.

4. Neutral Monism

• What it offers: Neutral monism posits that the fundamental “stuff” of the world is neither inherently mental nor distinctly physical. Instead, both mind and matter emerge from a deeper, neutral substrate. Conceptually, this framework dissolves the mind–body dichotomy and offers an attractive meeting ground for a phenomenon as puzzling as consciousness and for puzzling aspects of fundamental physics. One might view phenomena like quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, or even hints from the amplituhedron as expressions of an underlying, non-dual structure that manifests in different ways depending on context.

• Challenges: Some find this position somewhat “mysterious” because, while it promises to reconcile disparate domains, it does so by positing a level of reality that is itself very hard to characterize in ordinary terms. However, such challenges are not unlike those faced by the complicated geometrical formalisms of modern physics. In that sense, the move to a neutral substrate may mirror the trend in physics to find deeper unifying geometric or algebraic structures beneath the appearance of ordinary particles and fields.

5. Weighing the Options

When we compare these frameworks across the grounds of both empirical adequacy and conceptual scope, a few considerations emerge:

• Physicalism is methodologically robust in many contexts but tends to offer a “post hoc” explanation for consciousness and certain quantum puzzles.
  
• Panpsychism and analytic idealism each share the advantage of taking subjective experience seriously from the start and offer potential resolutions to the hard problem—while at the same time possibly opening the door to new ways of understanding non-local quantum correlations. However, both faces the challenge of rigorously showing how their posited fundamental experience or mind gives rise to the complex and quantitatively elaborate phenomena apparent in modern physics.

• Neutral monism, by positing an as-yet-unspecified neutral substrate, beautifully sidesteps some of the dualities that cause problems in other frameworks. It allows one to view both the mind and the mathematical structures arising in contemporary physics as different “aspects” or emergent features of the same underlying reality. In this way, puzzles like dark matter/energy, quantum measurement issues, and advanced geometric approaches (amplituhedron, cosmological polytopes) might all be reinterpretations of deeper monistic principles. Although neutral monism is not yet fully worked out in scientific detail, its conceptual elegance and potential to yield unifying insights mark it as particularly philosophically rigorous.

6. Conclusion

If we are looking for the framework that is most philosophically rigorous—that is, one which systematically integrates subjective experience with the theoretical puzzles of modern physics, while avoiding the pitfalls of dualism—then neutral monism appears particularly compelling. It neither reduces consciousness to inert matter (as some accuse physicalism of doing) nor introduces an overly anthropocentric or mystical element (a common criticism of analytic idealism or naive panpsychism). Instead, by positing a neutral basis from which both mind and matter emerge, neutral monism offers a promising metaphysical scaffold capable of integrating a wide range of empirical observations and theoretical challenges.

That said, it is important to acknowledge that each framework has its merits, and the debate remains open. Continued progress both in philosophical reflection and in empirical science may well refine or even radically transform our metaphysical outlook in the years ahead.
