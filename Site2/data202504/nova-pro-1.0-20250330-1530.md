Evaluating the most philosophically rigorous metaphysical framework is a complex task, as it involves balancing empirical adequacy, conceptual clarity, explanatory power, and coherence across various domains—namely consciousness science and contemporary physics. Here's an assessment of several prominent metaphysical frameworks:

### 1. **Analytic Idealism**
**Pros:**
- Directly addresses the hard problem of consciousness by positing that reality is fundamentally mental or experiential.
- Offers a parsimonious ontology—only one kind of substance (mind or experience).
  
**Cons:**
- Struggles with explaining the robust external world and intersubjective agreement in a way that is philosophically satisfying.
- Faces challenges in accommodating the empirical successes of physical sciences without resorting to ad hoc explanations.

**Verdict:** Strong on consciousness but weak in integrating physical reality seamlessly.

### 2. **Neutral Monism**
**Pros:**
- Proposes a single type of neutral substance that is neither mental nor physical but can give rise to both.
- Provides a potential framework for integrating consciousness and physical processes.

**Cons:**
- The nature of the neutral substrate is often vague and difficult to define precisely.
- Struggles with the hard problem of consciousness by potentially sidestepping rather than resolving it.

**Verdict:** Offers an intriguing middle ground but lacks detailed explanatory power for both consciousness and physical phenomena.

### 3. **Panpsychism**
**Pros:**
- Directly tackles the hard problem of consciousness by positing that consciousness is a fundamental feature of all entities.
- Can potentially integrate with quantum mechanics through theories like quantum panpsychism.

**Cons:**
- Faces the combination problem: how simple conscious experiences combine to form complex ones.
- May seem counterintuitive and lacks parsimony by attributing consciousness ubiquitously.

**Verdict:** Strong on addressing consciousness but faces significant conceptual hurdles.

### 4. **Physicalism**
**Pros:**
- Aligns well with the empirical findings and methodologies of the physical sciences.
- Offers a coherent and unified account of the physical world.

**Cons:**
- Faces significant challenges with the hard problem of consciousness.
- Struggles to incorporate qualia and subjective experience into its framework without seeming reductive.

**Verdict:** Excellent for physical reality but weak on consciousness.

### 5. **Cosmopsychism**
**Pros:**
- A variant of panpsychism that posits a cosmic consciousness as the fundamental entity.
- Attempts to solve the combination problem by suggesting that individual conscious experiences are aspects of a unified cosmic consciousness.

**Cons:**
- Highly speculative and not well-developed compared to other frameworks.
- Faces challenges in explaining how individual experiences arise from a unitary cosmic mind.

**Verdict:** Innovative but currently lacks robust theoretical and empirical support.

### Conclusion
**Most Rigorous Framework:** **Panpsychism**, particularly versions that engage deeply with quantum mechanics (e.g., quantum panpsychism), offers a compelling account that attempts to bridge the gap between consciousness and physical reality. While it faces significant challenges, especially the combination problem, its direct engagement with the hard problem of consciousness and potential integration with quantum phenomena make it a strong candidate for a rigorous metaphysical framework.

However, it’s crucial to note that the choice of the "most rigorous" framework is subjective and depends on weighing different philosophical virtues—such as explanatory power, simplicity, and empirical adequacy—against each other.
