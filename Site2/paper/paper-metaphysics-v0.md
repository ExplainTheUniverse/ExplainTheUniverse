The training data of the models is at least 5 terabytes of text data and not fully disclosed by their AI labs to date. So to dissect any potential bias from it would be a subject of a future study. By now we can make some conjunctures about the fact that all the models are optimized for top performance on STEM and academic subjects in general, what means that physicalism would be heavily represented, more than neutral monism e much more than analytic idealism, since physicalism is dominant in academia, even in Philosophy (see Apenddix III: The Prevalence of Physicalism in Contemporary Philosophy).
